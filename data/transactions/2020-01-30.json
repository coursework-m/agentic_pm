    "reasoning": "AAPL has strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also positive, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may make it challenging to buy. I allocate 3.5% to AAPL due to its potential for long-term growth."
