    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong fundamental position, with a PE ratio of 30.42 and EPS of 6.42, and its attractive dividend yield of 0.53%, make it a solid long-term investment. The recent decline in price is likely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but the company's strong brand and ecosystem make it a stable choice."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a neutral view from analysts, with an average analyst recommendation score of 1.58. The company's recent decline in price is due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing competition in the advertising market. While its dominant position in the search engine market is a positive aspect, the neutral view from analysts and the recent price decline make it a less attractive choice for a conservative portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong fundamental position, with a PE ratio of 34.84 and EPS of 12.92. The company's recent decline in price is due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing competition in the software market. However, its dominant position in the enterprise software market and its strong brand make it a solid long-term investment. The positive view from analysts, with an average recommendation score of 1.42, further supports this recommendation."
