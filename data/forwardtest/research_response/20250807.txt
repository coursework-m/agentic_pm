```

Note that I have assigned a target allocation percentage to MSFT and AMZN as they have strong fundamentals and are recommended to be held in the portfolio. AAPL, NVDA, and GOOG are also recommended, but with lower allocation percentages due to their high valuations. META and TSLA are not recommended due to their mixed fundamentals and challenges in their respective markets. NFLX is not recommended due to its declining EPS and challenges in the streaming market.
