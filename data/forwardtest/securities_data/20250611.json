Roblox (RBLX) had a really strong Q1, with revenue, bookings, and daily active users all up by double digits compared to the same quarter last year. For the full year, Roblox sees revenue of $4.3 billion to $4.365 billion, up about 19.5% year over year. Adjusted operating profits are forecast between $205 million and $265 million.
