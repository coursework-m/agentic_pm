        "summary": "You can catch Opening Bid on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, YouTube, or wherever you get your podcasts. What started 40 years ago as a company focused on \"quality communications\" by Irwin Jacobs has morphed into Qualcomm (QCOM) today. The company is one of the biggest players in the chip industry, supplying products to Apple (AAPL) to power its iPhone and to automakers to power their increasingly digital cockpits. The company's market cap stands at an impressive $163 billion. At the helm as CEO since 2021 is 30-year Qualcomm veteran Cristiano Amon, who started at the company as an engineer. Amon has been moving aggressively to diversify the business away from Apple into areas such as industrial applications and, more recently, data centers. Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi sits down on the Opening Bid podcast with Amon to discuss the next 40 years for Qualcomm. Amon is fresh off a trip to Saudi Arabia, joining President Donald Trump and other top tech executives. Amon secured a key memorandum of understanding to help Saudi Arabia build out AI data centers. Sozzi and Amon discuss the trip and what greater trade tensions mean for Qualcomm's important China business. Last year, China represented 46% of Qualcomm's sales.
