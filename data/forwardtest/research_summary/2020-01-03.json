    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong track record of innovation and growth, combined with its relatively stable fundamentals (P/E ratio of 30.42 and EPS of $6.42) and a positive analyst rating of 2.09 out of 5, make it a suitable addition to a conservative portfolio."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a high valuation (P/E ratio of 18.80 and EPS of $8.96) and a neutral analyst rating of 1.58 out of 5, which may indicate a less stable stock. Additionally, the company's dividend yield of 0.50% is relatively low, which may not provide sufficient income for investors seeking higher yields."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong track record of innovation and growth, combined with its relatively stable fundamentals (P/E ratio of 34.84 and EPS of $12.92) and a positive analyst rating of 1.42 out of 5. However, the company's high valuation may make it less suitable for a conservative portfolio. Therefore, I recommend a lower target allocation percentage of 6.0% to balance the portfolio."
