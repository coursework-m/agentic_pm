    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "AAPL has a high P/E ratio, but its strong fundamentals, including a high EPS and large market capitalization, suggest it may be a good long-term investment. However, the recent decline in price and news about the COVID-19 pandemic may impact its short-term performance."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a high P/E ratio and high beta, suggesting it may be overvalued. Its high dependence on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, and the recent decline in its stock price may not be a buying opportunity."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong track record of innovation, diversified product portfolio, and low beta, suggesting it is undervalued compared to its peers. Its recent decline in stock price may be a buying opportunity, and its strong financials and market share in the software industry make it a good long-term investment."
