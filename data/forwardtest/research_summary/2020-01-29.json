    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong brand and diverse product portfolio, combined with a forward PE ratio of 23.5 and EPS of $6.42, indicate a generally positive outlook. The recent decline in price may be a buying opportunity."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's decline in stock price due to increased competition in the advertising market, combined with a neutral analyst recommendation score of 1.58, indicates a neutral outlook. While Alphabet's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence suggest potential for undervaluation, the current market conditions do not justify a buy recommendation."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT's steady growth in cloud-based services and software sales, combined with a forward PE ratio of 30.1 and analyst recommendation score of 1.42, indicate a generally positive outlook. The stock's price volatility and recent decline may be a buying opportunity, and Microsoft's strong brand presence and diversified revenue streams suggest undervaluation."
