    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong brand and diverse product portfolio, along with a relatively stable financial position (PE ratio of 30.42 and EPS of 6.42), make it a suitable addition to a conservative portfolio."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has faced challenges in the current market, with a decline in price and volume. The company's fundamentals, including a PE ratio of 18.80 and EPS of 8.96, indicate a relatively stable financial position, but the decline in price and volume may indicate a potential correction. Analysts have a neutral stance, which makes it less suitable for a conservative portfolio."
