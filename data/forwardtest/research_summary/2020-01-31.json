    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. Despite the decline in iPhone sales and increasing competition in the smartphone market, Apple's strong brand and diversified product portfolio contribute to its stability. The company's high price-to-earnings ratio and dividend yield make it an attractive option for investors seeking stable returns."

  {
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's decline in advertising revenue due to increased competition and its uncertain growth prospects make it a cautious buy. The company's diversified revenue streams provide a cushion against this decline, but the neutral analyst consensus rating indicates a hold recommendation."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has shown strong growth in its cloud services segment, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure platform. However, its dependence on the US market and relatively high price-to-earnings ratio make it vulnerable to economic downturns. The positive analyst consensus rating indicates a buy recommendation, but investors should consider the company's growth prospects and ability to expand its cloud services globally."
