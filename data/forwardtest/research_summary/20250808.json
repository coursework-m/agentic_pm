    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "AAPL's recent market data and fundamentals indicate a strong performance, driven by the company's significant investment in the US, which is expected to have a positive impact on the company's operations and stock price. The company's recent announcement of a $100 billion investment in the US has led to a 13% rise in the stock price, and the analyst recommendation score is at 1.93182, indicating a strong buy signal. However, some analysts have expressed concerns that the investment may be more of an optics play than a real operational gain, which could impact the stock's long-term performance. Considering these factors, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to AAPL, as it offers a balance between short-term gains and long-term potential."

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc.'s strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the tech industry and growing revenue streams, suggest a positive outlook. The company's high price-to-earnings ratio and forward price-to-earnings ratio indicate investor confidence in its future growth prospects. Although the recent news about Intel's decline and the mixed day for stocks may have a negative impact on the overall market sentiment, the analyst recommendation score indicates a generally positive sentiment towards the stock. Considering these factors, I recommend holding a 3.5% allocation to Alphabet Inc. as a conservative investment option."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft Corporation's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward P/E ratio of 34.92 and EPS of $13.65, indicating a solid growth potential. The recent news of OpenAI's release of its latest model, GPT-OSS, has boosted Microsoft's Azure AI lead, with DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria reaffirming a Buy rating and $650.00 price target. However, the recent layoffs in the tech industry, including Nextdoor and Intel, may indicate a cautious outlook. Considering the company's diversified business model and strong fundamentals, I recommend holding a 3.5% allocation to MSFT in the portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Despite recent market volatility, Meta Platforms, Inc.'s fundamentals show signs of resilience, driven by a strong earnings report and a relatively low P/E ratio. However, the company's exposure to the tech industry and recent layoffs in the sector may pose some risks. Given the analyst's cautious optimism and the company's stable performance, I recommend holding a 3.5% allocation to Meta in a conservative portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.0,
    "reasoning": "TSLA's strong earnings growth, dominant position in the electric vehicle market, and recent buy signals from Google, Apple, and the Nasdaq's high suggest a positive outlook. Although the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and beta indicate a high level of volatility, the overall fundamentals and recent news suggest a potential upward trend. Therefore, a conservative allocation of 3% to TSLA is recommended."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "NVDA's strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the graphics and compute markets, and the recent news of President Trump's exemption of some chipmakers from the 100% semiconductor tariff, align with a bullish outlook. The analyst's recommendation of BUY further supports this conclusion, indicating a relatively high potential for growth. However, the high P/E ratio and beta of 2.145 may indicate some volatility, warranting a conservative target allocation of 3.5%."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 2.5,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's recent market volatility and slowdown in growth may be a buying opportunity, but its strong fundamentals, including its high market capitalization and stable EPS, suggest that it may be able to weather the storm. The recent news about The Trade Desk's stock crash and Apple's relationship with Trump may have a negative impact on the overall market, but Amazon's diversified business model and strong brand may help it to mitigate these effects. Given these factors, I recommend holding a 2.5% allocation to Amazon in a conservative portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Netflix, Inc.'s strong fundamentals, including a forward P/E ratio of 50.95206 and an EPS of $23.49, indicate a solid growth potential. The company's large market capitalization of $514.9 billion also suggests a stable market presence. Recent news suggesting Alphabet (GOOGL) needs a breakup to unlock full value may have a positive impact on Netflix's stock price, but the neutral analyst recommendation score of 2.0 suggests a cautious approach. Considering these factors, I recommend allocating 3.5% of the portfolio to NFLX."
