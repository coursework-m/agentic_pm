    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong brand, loyal customer base, and recent acquisition of Dark Sky demonstrate its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams. The company's fundamentals, including a PE ratio of 30.42 and EPS of $6.42, indicate a strong financial position."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's PE ratio of 18.80 and EPS of $8.96 are slightly lower than its historical averages, and the company's advertising revenue has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysts have a neutral outlook for the company, which suggests that the stock may not be a good fit for a conservative portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 2.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT is a leader in the software industry with a strong track record of innovation and a large customer base. The company's recent acquisition of Nuance Communications has expanded its presence in the healthcare market, and its expansion into the cloud computing market with Azure has been successful. However, the company's PE ratio of 34.84 and EPS of $12.92 are higher than its historical averages, which may indicate a higher risk for a conservative portfolio."
