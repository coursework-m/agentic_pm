    "summary": "Apple Inc. is a leader in the technology industry with a strong track record of innovation and a loyal customer base. The company's recent acquisition of Dark Sky, a popular weather app, and its expansion into the wearables market with the Apple Watch, demonstrate its commitment to diversifying its revenue streams. With a forward P/E ratio of 23.5 and an EPS of $6.42, Apple appears to be undervalued compared to its historical averages. The company's beta of 1.275 indicates a relatively high level of volatility, but its strong brand and financials suggest that it can withstand market fluctuations. Analysts have a consensus rating of 2.09 out of 5, indicating a generally positive outlook. Overall, Apple's strong fundamentals and growth prospects make it an attractive buy.",
