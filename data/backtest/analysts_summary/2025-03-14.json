    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading days, with a drop of 5.5% in the past 24 hours. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in interest rates, which has led to a decrease in volatility expectations and subsequently a decrease in the VIX index.
