The recent news about a 6.4 magnitude earthquake in Taiwan, which affected TSMC, a key supplier, may also have a positive impact on AAPL's stock price.

    "ticker": "VXX",
    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.14% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has been rising due to market volatility concerns. However, the ETN's price has been volatile in the past, and its value can be affected by various market and economic factors. The lack of fundamental data available for VXX, including P/E ratio, EPS, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to make an informed decision. Despite this, the recent increase in the VIX index suggests that investors may be becoming more cautious, which could lead to further price declines. Therefore, based on the available data, I recommend a HOLD position on VXX.",
