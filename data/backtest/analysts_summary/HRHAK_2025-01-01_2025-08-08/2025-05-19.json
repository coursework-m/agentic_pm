    "ticker": "VXX",
    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in its price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.62% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the demand for VIX futures contracts. Despite this, the ETN's price has been volatile in the past, and its value can be affected by various market and economic factors. The lack of fundamental data available for VXX, including EPS, P/E ratio, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to make an informed decision. However, considering the current market conditions and the overall trend of the VIX index, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX.",
