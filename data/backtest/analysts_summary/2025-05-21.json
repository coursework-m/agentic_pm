    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has shown a significant increase in price over the past few trading days, driven by rising market volatility. The current price of $55.66 indicates a potential buying opportunity, as the price has been trending upwards and is approaching its 50-day moving average.
