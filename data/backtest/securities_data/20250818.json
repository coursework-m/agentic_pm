Foxconn's heavy reliance on the smartphone business has long been viewed by investors as a significant\u00a0risk, as demand growth for new iPhones has gradually weakened since they were first introduced nearly two decades ago, leaving the top iPhone assembler grappling with slowing sales momentum, analysts said.",
