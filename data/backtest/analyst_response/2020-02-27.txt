After analyzing the latest market data, news, and fundamentals for each stock, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "summary": "Apple Inc. has shown resilience in the current market downturn, with a strong brand and diverse product portfolio. The company's recent earnings report showed a slight decrease in revenue, but its EPS and dividend yield remain attractive. Analysts expect Apple to continue its growth trajectory, making it a BUY recommendation.",
        "recommendation": "BUY"
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "summary": "Alphabet Inc. has faced increased competition in the advertising market, leading to a decline in its stock price. However, the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence provide a solid foundation for long-term growth. Analysts expect Alphabet to continue to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, making it a HOLD recommendation.",
        "recommendation": "HOLD"
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "summary": "Microsoft Corporation has shown significant growth in its cloud computing segment, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure platform. However, the company's revenue growth has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty. Analysts expect Microsoft to continue its growth trajectory, but with a more cautious outlook, making it a BUY recommendation.",
        "recommendation": "BUY"
    }
]
```

Rationale:

* Apple Inc. (AAPL): Despite the recent market downturn, Apple's strong brand and diverse product portfolio provide a solid foundation for long-term growth. The company's recent earnings report showed a slight decrease in revenue, but its EPS and dividend yield remain attractive. Analysts expect Apple to continue its growth trajectory, driven by its loyal customer base and innovative products.
* Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Alphabet has faced increased competition in the advertising market, leading to a decline in its stock price. However, the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence provide a solid foundation for long-term growth. Analysts expect Alphabet to continue to innovate and adapt to changing market conditions, making it a HOLD recommendation.
* Microsoft Corporation (MSFT): Microsoft has shown significant growth in its cloud computing segment, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure platform. However, the company's revenue growth has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and global economic uncertainty. Analysts expect Microsoft to continue its growth trajectory, but with a more cautious outlook, making it a BUY recommendation.
