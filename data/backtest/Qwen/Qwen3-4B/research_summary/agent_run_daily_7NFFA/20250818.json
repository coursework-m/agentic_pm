    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.0,
    "reasoning": "Apple's fundamentals remain strong with a stable dividend yield, solid EPS, and a forward P/E ratio indicating reasonable growth expectations. However, recent news highlights competitive pressure from Samsung and supply chain diversification risks due to Foxconn's shift toward AI servers. While the stock declined slightly today, its market cap and sector position suggest resilience. The analyst's 'HOLD' recommendation aligns with a cautious approach, warranting a low allocation to balance risk and stability."

  {
    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) exhibits strong fundamentals with a robust P/E ratio (21.85), consistent EPS ($9.38), and a modest dividend yield (0.41%). While the stock closed slightly higher today (0.53%), its beta of 1.014 suggests moderate volatility. Analysts recommend 'HOLD' based on stable fundamentals, and AI-related sector news does not directly impact GOOG. The stock's large market cap and sector resilience make it a reasonable addition to a conservative portfolio at a low allocation."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft (MSFT) demonstrates robust fundamentals with strong earnings (EPS: $13.63), a competitive P/E ratio (38.16), and a 0.64% dividend yield. The company's AI-driven cloud infrastructure positions it well in emerging tech trends, supported by positive analyst scores (1.28) and sector leadership in software infrastructure. While the stock declined 0.44% today, this aligns with short-term market volatility rather than long-term weakness. The high market cap (>$3.8T) and defensive beta (1.05) suggest stability, making it suitable for a conservative portfolio allocation."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Meta shows stability with strong fundamentals (EPS: $27.56, P/E: 28.5) and AI-related relevance. The stock closed higher (+0.39%) with high volume, aligning with a conservative portfolio. However, the low dividend yield (0.27%) and moderate analyst score (1.45) warrant caution. The HOLD recommendation suggests prudence, making a 4% allocation appropriate for balanced exposure."

  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla's extreme high P/E ratio (195.6) and forward P/E (102.0) suggest significant overvaluation relative to earnings fundamentals. The stock fell 1.5% today amid UK leasing price cuts, reflecting sector-specific risks. While the Model Y L announcement in China offers growth potential, the high beta (2.33) and cyclical sector exposure (Consumer Cyclical) amplify volatility. Analysts recommend 'HOLD' but the current valuation and macroeconomic sensitivity make it unsuitable for a portfolio seeking stability."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "NVIDIA's elevated P/E ratio (58.21) and forward P/E (43.8) suggest overvaluation relative to earnings. The high beta (2.145) amplifies volatility, while recent price declines (-0.86%) correlate with pre-Fed Powell speech market anxiety. Analysts caution that macroeconomic headwinds could hurt growth stocks, and the low dividend yield (0.02%) indicates minimal income potential. Despite strong fundamentals, the combination of valuation risks and sensitivity to market swings makes it unsuitable for a conservative portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's stock is highly volatile (beta 1.31) and sensitive to macroeconomic risks like the Fed's Powell speech. While fundamentals are strong (EPS $6.56, P/E 35.22), recent market uncertainty and mixed AI sector news suggest short-term volatility. Analysts recommend 'HOLD,' indicating caution rather than allocation. Given the risks, a 0% allocation aligns with a conservative portfolio strategy."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Netflix demonstrates strong fundamentals with robust EPS ($23.42) and a high analyst rating (1.95652). Recent positive news highlights a strong content pipeline and viewer trends, supported by Piper Sandler's Buy rating. While the high P/E ratio (52.9) suggests valuation concerns, the stock's market performance (0.68% gain) and sector strength in Communication Services indicate potential for moderate growth. The narrow price range (day high/day low) and large market cap suggest stability, warranting a 4% allocation in a conservative portfolio."
