    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Apple's fundamentals remain robust with strong earnings (EPS: $6.58), a reasonable forward P/E ratio (27.81), and a stable dividend yield (0.45%). The stock trades within a narrow range amid a bullish market, and its beta (1.165) reflects moderate volatility. Analysts rate it highly (1.95/2), and recent market trends support a positive outlook. While the current P/E ratio (35.12) is elevated, the forward P/E and sector performance suggest sustainable growth potential."

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) exhibits strong fundamentals with a low P/E ratio (21.5), robust EPS ($9.38), and a stable dividend yield (0.41%). The analyst recommendation score (1.54) and recent bullish sentiment in news analysis support a positive outlook. While the stock closed -1.3% today amid high volume, this aligns with short-term volatility rather than long-term weakness. The company's dominant market position in digital advertising and cloud services, combined with a slightly above-market beta (1.01), suggests moderate risk. A 4% allocation balances exposure to its growth potential while mitigating volatility."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft's fundamentals remain strong with a stable P/E ratio (37.33) and consistent EPS of $13.65. The stock closed slightly lower (-1.45%) but traded within a narrow range (day high/day low of 515.16/509.02), indicating limited volatility. Analysts rate it positively (1.27586) with a 'HOLD' recommendation, and sector news about Intel's $2B stake suggests broader tech optimism. The 0.64% dividend yield provides income, and a beta of 1.055 aligns with market volatility. While the stock is down today, its strong fundamentals and sector context justify a conservative allocation."

  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Meta's fundamentals remain strong with a robust EPS of $27.55 and a reasonable P/E ratio of 27.29. However, the stock fell 2.02% today amid mixed market sentiment, including concerns about potential market dynamics shifts highlighted by Bank of America's commentary. The high volume and narrow trading range suggest volatility, but the analyst score of 1.45 indicates moderate optimism. The HOLD recommendation aligns with a conservative approach, balancing stability and growth potential in a large-cap tech sector."

    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla's extreme P/E ratio (197) and forward P/E (102) indicate significant overvaluation. The 2.33 beta suggests high volatility, while the -1.25% price decline reflects recent weakness. Analysts recommend 'SELL' amid mixed sector performance and no earnings data improvement. Rival Xpeng's rise in news does not offset Tesla's fundamental risks."

  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "NVIDIA's high P/E ratio (57.66) and forward P/E (43.25) suggest potential overvaluation. The stock closed lower (-2.11%) amid high volatility (beta 2.145), and recent news about Intel's surge and Bank of America's market regime shift commentary indicate caution for large-cap tech stocks. Despite strong fundamentals, the combination of valuation concerns, volatility, and market sentiment warrants a denial."

  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.0,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's fundamentals remain strong with a robust P/E ratio (34.9), growing EPS (6.55), and a high beta (1.31) reflecting its volatility. The stock closed slightly lower (-1.23%) but traded within a narrow range, with a massive market cap. Recent news focused on unrelated mergers and tech developments, with no direct impact on Amazon's operations. While the high beta indicates volatility, the company's strong fundamentals and market position justify a low allocation in a conservative portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Netflix's high P/E ratio (51.07) and forward P/E (50.53) indicate elevated valuation. The stock fell 3.5% today, trading near its day low, amid concerns over recent Q2 performance and mixed analyst signals. Despite a positive recommendation score of 1.95652, the recent decline and negative news suggest overvaluation and weak investor confidence, warranting a denial."
