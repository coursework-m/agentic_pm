    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Apple's fundamentals remain strong with a stable dividend yield (0.45%), robust EPS ($6.60), and a forward P/E ratio (27.87) indicating reasonable valuation. While the stock declined 0.51% today, the market cap ($3.4T) and sector strength (Technology) suggest resilience. However, recent news about Foxconn's shift away from Apple highlights potential supply chain risks. The analyst recommendation of 'HOLD' aligns with a cautious approach, justifying a moderate allocation of 4% for a balanced portfolio."

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) exhibits strong fundamentals with a low P/E ratio (21.85) and robust EPS ($9.38), suggesting undervaluation and profitability. The stock is slightly higher today (0.53%) with high volume, and analyst scores (1.54) indicate positive sentiment. While beta (1.01) reflects mild volatility, the company's market cap and sector position (Communication Services) align with a conservative portfolio. No direct negative news impacts the stock, making it a stable addition at 4% allocation."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft (MSFT) demonstrates robust fundamentals with a strong P/E ratio (38.16) and forward P/E (34.79), supported by consistent earnings ($13.63 EPS) and a 0.64% dividend yield. Recent news highlights AI growth opportunities (Jefferies analyst note) and a positive analyst score (1.27586). While the stock declined 0.44% today, the narrow price range (519.09-526.1) and market cap strength suggest stability. The slight beta (1.055) reflects moderate volatility consistent with a leading tech stock. The BUY recommendation aligns with long-term value potential in software/infrastructure sector."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Meta's strong fundamentals (EPS: $27.56, P/E: 28.49) and strategic AI momentum (Cohere hiring) justify a moderate allocation. While the high P/E (31.04 forward) and corporate culture news introduce minor uncertainty, the stock's 0.39% gain with heavy volume suggests moderate buyer interest. The HOLD recommendation aligns with a conservative approach, balancing growth potential with valuation concerns."

  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla's elevated P/E ratio (195.6) and forward P/E (102.0) indicate significant overvaluation relative to earnings. The high beta (2.33) suggests extreme volatility, while the recent -1.5% price decline reflects market caution. Although the Asia-Pacific e-bike market growth is positive for EVs, it does not directly impact Tesla's valuation. The analyst's 'HOLD' recommendation underscores concerns about overvaluation and volatility, making this security unsuitable for allocation in a conservative portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "NVIDIA's high P/E ratio (58.21) and elevated beta (2.145) indicate significant volatility and potential overvaluation. Recent price declines (-0.86%) correlate with Fed policy concerns, adding to market uncertainty. While fundamentals like EPS ($3.1) are strong, the combination of high volatility, elevated valuation, and macroeconomic risks (e.g., Powell's Jackson Hole speech) warrants caution. Analysts recommend 'HOLD,' but given the security's inherent risk profile, a 0% allocation aligns with a conservative portfolio strategy."

  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's strong fundamentals (EPS $6.56, P/E 35.22) and market cap suggest resilience, but elevated valuation (forward P/E 37.57) and high beta (1.31) indicate sensitivity to market volatility. Recent news of Fed-related market dips and mixed analyst sentiment highlight short-term headwinds. The 'HOLD' recommendation aligns with a conservative approach, warranting a low allocation to balance growth potential with risk."

  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Netflix shows strong fundamentals with a robust content pipeline and improving viewership, supported by a high analyst recommendation score (1.956) and positive news. However, elevated P/E ratios (52.9) suggest potential overvaluation. The stock's volatility (beta 1.59) and narrow price range indicate caution. A 4% allocation aligns with a conservative portfolio, balancing growth potential with risk management."
