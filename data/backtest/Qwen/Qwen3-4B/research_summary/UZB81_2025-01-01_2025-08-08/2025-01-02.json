    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Apple's fundamentals remain robust with strong earnings (EPS: $6.6), a reasonable forward P/E ratio (27.6), and a stable dividend yield (0.47%). The company's leadership in the high-growth Technology sector, combined with recent positive news (CEO Tim Cook's upbeat New Year message and strategic pricing adjustments in China), supports a bullish outlook. While the stock closed -2.04% today, this aligns with broader market volatility rather than fundamental weakness. The analyst's BUY recommendation and strong sector position justify a moderate allocation."

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) exhibits strong fundamentals with a low P/E ratio (21.57), robust EPS ($9.37), and a stable dividend yield (0.43%). The stock's beta of 1.01 indicates moderate volatility, aligning with a conservative portfolio. Recent positive news from tech leaders (Tim Cook, Mark Zuckerberg) and a high analyst recommendation score (1.54) reinforce long-term potential. While today's -0.45% price decline reflects short-term market noise, the company's dominant market position in Communication Services and strong financials justify a cautious allocation."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft's fundamentals remain strong with a leading market cap in Technology, solid dividend yield (0.64%), and robust forward P/E ratio (34.92). While today's -1.63% decline reflects short-term volatility, the analyst recommendation score (1.28) and sector-wide AI/cloud growth (Azure, AI initiatives) suggest long-term resilience. Neutral sentiment from TikTok news is irrelevant to Microsoft's core business, and NVIDIA's AI investments highlight sector optimism. Beta of 1.055 aligns with large-cap stability."

  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Meta (META) demonstrates strong fundamentals with robust earnings (EPS: $27.58) and a reasonable P/E ratio (27.89). The stock closed higher (+1.61%) with elevated volume, reflecting investor confidence. Bullish analyst score (1.44), positive sector sentiment, and recent tech-sector optimism (e.g., CEO greetings, AI collaborations) support a BUY recommendation. While beta (1.27) indicates moderate volatility, the company's market cap and growth prospects align with a conservative portfolio allocation."

    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla's high P/E ratio (196.22) and forward P/E (101.74) suggest overvaluation relative to earnings. The stock fell 2.77% amid negative news about a Cybertruck explosion linked to a Las Vegas incident, raising brand reputation concerns. A beta of 2.33 indicates significant volatility, and the lack of dividend yield underscores income risk. While analysts recommend 'HOLD', the combination of overvaluation, recent negative sentiment, and high volatility makes this stock unsuitable for a conservative portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "NVIDIA demonstrates strong fundamentals with robust EPS ($3.12) and a dominant $3.37T market cap in the semiconductors sector. Bullish news on $1B AI investments and a 1.415 analyst score support growth potential. However, elevated P/E (58.56) and high beta (2.145) indicate volatility and growth expectations. The 1.7% price increase today reflects market confidence, but the stock's sensitivity to AI sector dynamics and macroeconomic conditions requires a conservative allocation."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's strong fundamentals (robust EPS, large market cap) and sector leadership justify cautious allocation. While the elevated P/E ratio (33.95) and slight price decline (-0.82%) suggest caution, the HOLD analyst recommendation and mixed news (Bezos story, AI-focused coverage) indicate stability. Beta of 1.31 implies moderate volatility, aligning with a conservative portfolio. Low allocation reflects prudence given market conditions."

  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Netflix's high P/E ratio (51.58) and forward P/E (50.95) suggest overvaluation relative to earnings. The stock closed lower (-0.98%) amid a volatile beta (1.589), indicating sensitivity to market swings. While news about Squid Game Season 3 and live sports ambitions are neutral, analyst scores and fundamentals point to cautious sentiment. The market cap ($376B) reflects strong pricing but raises concerns about sustainability. Holding the stock in a portfolio without a specific growth bias is risky given these factors."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "VXX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 2.5,
    "reasoning": "VXX shows strong price momentum (3.86% gain) with high volume, reflecting bullish sentiment toward volatility. However, as a leveraged ETN, it amplifies both gains and losses. While the analyst recommends 'BUY', its structured product nature and lack of fundamental metrics suggest caution. A low allocation (2.5%) aligns with risk management, given the ETN's sensitivity to volatility shifts and potential for rapid drawdowns in declining markets."
