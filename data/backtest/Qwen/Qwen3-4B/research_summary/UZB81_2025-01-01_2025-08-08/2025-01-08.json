    "reasoning": "Apple Inc. (AAPL) shows strong fundamentals with a high P/E ratio (34.75) and forward P/E (27.6) reflecting growth expectations. The stock closed slightly higher (0.32%) with robust volume, and analyst scores are positive (1.93). Recent news highlights its role in the 'Magnificent Seven' and stable dividend yield (0.47%).

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) exhibits strong fundamentals with a low P/E ratio (21.57) suggesting potential undervaluation, robust EPS ($9.37), and a beta of 1.01 indicating slight volatility. The stock closed higher (0.74%) with elevated volume, aligning with positive analyst sentiment (score: 1.54) and a BUY recommendation. While the dividend yield (0.43%) is modest, the company's dominant market position in digital services and cloud computing, combined with its large market cap, supports a conservative allocation."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft's strong fundamentals (EPS: $13.68, 0.64% dividend yield) and robust market cap ($3.16T) suggest stability. While the elevated P/E ratio (38.16) indicates potential overvaluation, the forward P/E (34.92) reflects growth expectations. Mixed news includes a bullish Amazon AWS investment (somewhat bullish) and a neutral OpenAI lawsuit. Analysts' moderate optimism (score: 1.27586) and the company's dominant position in cloud/enterprise software support a cautious allocation. The stock's beta (1.055) and price volatility (\u00b12.6% intraday) warrant a low, conservative allocation."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Meta's fundamentals remain strong with robust EPS ($27.58), reasonable P/E (27.89), and a low beta (1.27) indicating moderate volatility. While the stock declined 0.44% amid broader tech sector weakness (S&P 500 down 1%), its market cap ($1.3T) and sector (Communication Services) suggest resilience. Analysts show cautious optimism (composite score 1.44), and the low dividend yield (0.28%) aligns with a conservative portfolio. However, sector-specific risks and recent market volatility warrant a low allocation to mitigate exposure."

    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla's high P/E ratio (196.22) and forward P/E (101.74) suggest overvaluation, while its beta of 2.33 indicates significant volatility. Recent news about supplier CATL and Tencent facing U.S. military blacklist allegations adds uncertainty, though sentiment is somewhat bullish. Analysts recommend 'HOLD' due to fundamental concerns and market risks. Given the overvaluation and high volatility, the security is not suitable for allocation."

  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "NVIDIA's strong fundamentals (EPS: $3.12, forward P/E: 44.34) reflect confidence in AI/semiconductor leadership, but the China-specific RTX 5090D card (29% AI performance cut due to trade sanctions) introduces risk. The stock closed -1.73% with high volume, indicating mixed sentiment. While the high beta (2.14) suggests volatility, the analyst's 'HOLD' recommendation and stable market cap ($3.4T) justify a moderate allocation. The positive Amazon AWS investment news (somewhat-bullish) provides sector-level support, but the trade sanction risk requires caution."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's fundamentals remain robust with a strong market cap, solid EPS, and a forward P/E ratio reflecting growth expectations. Recent news highlights AWS's $11B Georgia investment and Mexico's import tariffs benefiting Amazon, while a high analyst score (1.32) underscores positive outlook. The slight price decline (-0.47%) may present a buying opportunity. Although the stock has a beta of 1.31 (moderately volatile), the combination of strong fundamentals, positive macroeconomic tailwinds, and a BUY recommendation justify a moderate allocation."

    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "Netflix shows strong fundamentals with robust EPS ($23.49) and a forward P/E of 50.95, supported by positive analyst sentiment (score: 2.0). However, the high P/E ratio (51.58) and volatility (beta: 1.59) suggest overvaluation risks. Recent news highlights its streaming dominance, but the 0.57% price drop and sector-specific volatility warrant a conservative allocation. The 'HOLD' recommendation aligns with caution, making 4% a reasonable target for a balanced portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "VXX",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "VXX closed sharply lower (-1.57%) amid high volume, with price near daily low suggesting bearish momentum. Analysts recommend 'SELL' and fundamentals are unavailable due to ETN structure. The VIX volatility index (underlying factor) indicates market fear, but VXX's price decline reflects investor selling pressure. This aligns with a conservative portfolio avoidance strategy."
