The company's EPS has been steadily increasing, indicating strong underlying profitability. However, the beta of 1.273 suggests that the stock may be more volatile than the overall market. The recent analyst recommendation score of 1.44118 indicates a generally positive sentiment among analysts. Despite this, the stock has been experiencing a decline in price and volume, which may be a sign of investor caution. Overall, the data suggests that the stock is due for a rebound, but the current market conditions and recent price decline make it a HOLD recommendation.",
