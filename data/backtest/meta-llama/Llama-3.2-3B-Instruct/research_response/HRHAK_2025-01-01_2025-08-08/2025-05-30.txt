Despite this, the market capitalization remains stable at $53.83. The lack of recent news and analyst recommendations makes it challenging to determine the underlying cause of this decline. However, the VIX index has been trending downward, which could indicate a decrease in investor sentiment towards volatility. Given the current market conditions and the lack of fundamental data, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation. Nevertheless, considering the short-term nature of the ETN and the potential for volatility to increase in the near future, a cautious approach may be warranted.",
