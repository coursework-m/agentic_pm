    You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,

    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations
        - The Analysis summary

    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{
        "ticker": "...",
        "approved": true,

    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while

    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
