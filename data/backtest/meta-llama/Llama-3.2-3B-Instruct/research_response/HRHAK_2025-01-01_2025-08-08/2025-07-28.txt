Additionally, the neutral sentiment from recent news articles and somewhat-bullish sentiment from short interest suggest that the stock may be due for a bounce, but the overall risk profile of the company remains high. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any significant portion of the portfolio to NFLX at this time."
