    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.20% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the demand for VIX futures contracts.
