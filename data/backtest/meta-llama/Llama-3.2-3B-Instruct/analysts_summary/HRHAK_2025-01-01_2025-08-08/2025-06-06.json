    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in its price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 1.59% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has been rising due to concerns over inflation and interest rates.

The lack of fundamental data available for VXX, including PE ratio, forward PE, EPS, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to make an informed decision. However, the current news and analyst recommendations are not available, which further complicates the analysis. Given the current market conditions and the limited information available, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation for VXX.",
