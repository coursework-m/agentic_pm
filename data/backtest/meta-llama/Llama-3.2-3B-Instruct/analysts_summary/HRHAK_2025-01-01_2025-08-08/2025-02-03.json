    "ticker": "VXX",
    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading days, with a drop of 4.37% in the past 24 hours. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the demand for VIX futures contracts. However, the underlying VIX index has not shown a corresponding increase, indicating that the decline in VXX price may be driven by market sentiment rather than a fundamental change in the VIX index itself.",
