    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.5% in the past day. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in interest rates, which has led to a decrease in investor appetite for volatility-based investments. However, the VIX index, which the ETN tracks, has been relatively stable, indicating that the underlying volatility is not increasing. The lack of a clear catalyst for the price drop and the stable VIX index suggest that the decline may be overdone, making it a potential buying opportunity.",
