    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "summary": "AAPL's fundamentals remain strong, with a PE ratio of 34.75 and EPS of 6.6, indicating a healthy growth trajectory. The company's beta of 1.165 suggests some volatility, but its market capitalization of $2.99 trillion provides a significant cushion. Recent news suggests a somewhat-bullish sentiment, with a score of 0.171601 from Benzinga. However, the analyst recommendation score of 1.93182 is slightly above the midpoint of the 1-5 scale, indicating a generally positive outlook. Considering these factors, I recommend holding onto AAPL.",

    "ticker": "META",
    "summary": "Meta Platforms, Inc. has experienced a significant decline in its stock price over the past few days, with a -1.99% drop in the past 24 hours. Despite this, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58. The beta of 1.27 indicates a relatively high volatility, but the company's dividend yield of 0.28% suggests a relatively stable income stream. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. However, the recent decline in stock price may be a response to the increasing competition in the social media space and the company's struggles to adapt to the changing user behavior. Overall, the company's fundamentals suggest a HOLD recommendation, but the recent price drop may be a buying opportunity.",

    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "summary": "NVIDIA Corporation's strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the graphics and compute markets, and its ability to capitalize on the growing demand for artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicle solutions, make it an attractive investment opportunity. The recent news of President Trump's tariff reprieve for technology products is also a positive factor, as it reduces the risk of trade tensions affecting NVIDIA's business. However, the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and beta of 2.145 indicate that it may be overvalued. Overall, the recommendation is to HOLD, as the potential benefits of NVIDIA's growth prospects outweigh the risks.",
