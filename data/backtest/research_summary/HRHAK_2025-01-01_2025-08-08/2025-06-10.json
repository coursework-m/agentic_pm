    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Although AAPL's fundamentals remain strong, the recent introduction of Liquid Glass in iOS 26 has raised concerns among investors, and the mixed sentiment analysis of news articles suggests a somewhat-bullish tone with some criticism of the new design. Additionally, the company's beta is slightly above the industry average, indicating a higher volatility. Given these factors, I would recommend a HOLD recommendation due to the potential risks associated with the new design."

  {
    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc.'s strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the tech industry, and a somewhat-bullish market sentiment, suggest a HOLD recommendation. The company's high P/E ratio and forward P/E ratio indicate a relatively high valuation, but its strong EPS and dividend yield provide a cushion. The recent news articles, while not directly related to GOOG, suggest a positive market outlook, which may benefit the stock. Analyst recommendations are generally positive, indicating a buy signal. Given the overall positive sentiment and strong fundamentals, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to GOOG, providing a balanced and diversified portfolio."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft Corporation's strong fundamentals, including a relatively low forward P/E ratio and high EPS, indicate a potential for growth. The company's substantial market capitalization and slightly above 1 beta suggest some level of volatility, but the recent news on the AI revolution and the analyst recommendation score of 1.27586, which is bullish, support the approval. The slight decline in price may be a buying opportunity, and a conservative allocation of 3.5% to MSFT is recommended."

  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "The company's strong fundamentals, including a relatively low P/E ratio and high EPS, indicate a potential for growth. The recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a bullish sentiment, with a high analyst recommendation score. However, considering the company's significant market capitalization and slightly above-average beta, a conservative allocation of 3.5% is recommended to mitigate potential volatility."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "TSLA's strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the electric vehicle market and growing energy generation and storage business, suggest a BUY recommendation. The company's high P/E ratio and beta indicate investor confidence in its future growth prospects. Recent news articles highlight the company's resilience to market fluctuations, particularly the recovery following a tumultuous week involving Elon Musk and President Trump. However, the analyst recommendation score indicates a slightly bearish bias, which should be considered. Overall, the data suggests a BUY recommendation, but with a cautious approach."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "NVDA's strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the AI and gaming markets, and a bullish sentiment from analysts, make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's recent news highlights the growing importance of AI in various industries, which is expected to drive its growth. However, the high price-to-earnings ratio and beta value may indicate some volatility. Considering a conservative approach, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to NVDA, allowing for potential upside while managing risk."

  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Although Amazon.com, Inc. has a strong fundamental profile with a forward P/E ratio of 36.21 and an EPS of $6.56, the current price of $217.61 is relatively high, and the company's market capitalization of $2.23 trillion may indicate a high valuation. Additionally, the recent news articles suggest a somewhat-bullish sentiment, but the analyst recommendation score of 1.32 is not enough to overcome the concerns about the high valuation. Therefore, a conservative approach is recommended, and the security is not recommended for allocation."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Although the analyst's summary suggests a somewhat-bullish sentiment and strong fundamentals, the recent decline in stock price may indicate a potential correction. Additionally, the shift away from digital advertising could be a concern for the company's revenue growth. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating a significant portion of the portfolio to NFLX at this time."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "VXX",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "The security's price has declined significantly in the past few trading sessions, which may be a sign of market uncertainty. However, the lack of fundamental data and analyst recommendations makes it challenging to make an informed decision. Additionally, the absence of news articles and a clear recommendation from the analyst summary suggests that the security may not be a stable investment option at this time."
