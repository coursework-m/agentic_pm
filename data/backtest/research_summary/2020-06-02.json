    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "AAPL has strong fundamentals, a high P/E ratio, and a growing EPS. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may indicate a potential bubble. Considering the overall positive outlook and the company's stable position in the market, I recommend a moderate allocation to AAPL."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a mixed outlook due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the advertising industry. Although the company has a strong track record of innovation and growth, the recent news and analyst recommendations are not overwhelmingly positive. Additionally, the stock's price is relatively high, which may indicate a potential bubble. I do not recommend allocating to GOOGL at this time."

    "reasoning": "MSFT has strong fundamentals, a high P/E ratio, and a growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are overwhelmingly positive, and its diversified business model and strong cash reserves provide a solid foundation for long-term growth. I recommend a higher allocation to MSFT due to its stable position in the market and its potential for continued growth."
