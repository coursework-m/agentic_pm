    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "AAPL's recent market data shows a significant increase in price, driven by the company's announcement of a $100 billion investment in the US. The investment is seen as a strategic move to mitigate the impact of tariffs and boost domestic production. The company's fundamentals, including a forward PE ratio of 27.6 and EPS of 6.6, suggest a strong financial position. However, some analysts have expressed concerns that the investment may be more of an optics play than a material operational gain. Considering the mixed signals from the market and analyst community, I recommend holding a 3.5% allocation to AAPL to capture the potential long-term growth while managing risk."

    "ticker": "GOOG",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Alphabet Inc.'s strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the search engine market and growing cloud computing business, suggest a BUY recommendation. The company's high price-to-earnings ratio and forward price-to-earnings ratio indicate a high growth potential. Additionally, the recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a positive outlook for the stock. However, considering the current market volatility and the high allocation percentage, a conservative target allocation of 3.5% is recommended."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Microsoft Corporation's strong fundamentals, driven by its high price-to-earnings ratio and significant analyst recommendation score, make it a good candidate for a long-term investment. The recent news about OpenAI's release of its latest model, GPT-OSS, has boosted Microsoft's Azure's AI lead, which is expected to drive growth. However, the company's recent layoffs and the overall market volatility may pose some risks. Considering a conservative approach, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to MSFT, allowing for potential upside while minimizing potential losses."

  {
    "ticker": "META",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "Although the analyst's summary suggests a HOLD recommendation, the recent layoffs by Meta may indicate a potential correction in the company's growth prospects. Additionally, the high P/E ratio and beta value suggest that the stock may be overvalued. Considering these factors, I do not recommend allocating any funds to Meta at this time."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "TSLA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.0,
    "reasoning": "Tesla, Inc.'s strong growth prospects, driven by increasing demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy solutions, and its leadership in the EV market, outweigh concerns about its high valuation and recent leadership exits. The analyst's recommendation of BUY is supported by the company's solid fundamentals, including its high EPS and beta, and the positive news surrounding its leadership in the EV market. However, a conservative allocation of 3% is recommended to mitigate the high valuation risk."

  {
    "ticker": "NVDA",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "NVDA's strong fundamentals, driven by its dominant position in the graphics and compute markets, and the recent exemption from semiconductor tariffs by President Trump, make it an attractive investment opportunity. The high P/E ratio and beta of 2.145 indicate a high level of volatility, but the positive analyst recommendation score of 1.41538 suggests that investors are confident in the company's prospects. Therefore, I recommend allocating 3.5% of the portfolio to NVDA."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "AMZN",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "Amazon's recent market volatility and slowdown in growth, combined with its strong fundamentals and positive analyst sentiment, suggest a HOLD recommendation. However, considering the current market conditions and the company's stable position in the e-commerce industry, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to AMZN, taking into account its potential for long-term growth and its ability to adapt to changing market conditions."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "NFLX",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
    "reasoning": "NFLX has shown a strong upward trend in its stock price, with a recent increase of 2.65% and a market capitalization of over $514 billion. The company's fundamentals, including a forward PE ratio of 50.95 and EPS of $23.49, indicate a relatively high valuation. However, the beta of 1.59 suggests that the stock may be sensitive to market fluctuations. Recent news suggests that Alphabet (GOOGL) needs a breakup to unlock full value, which may have a positive impact on the entertainment industry as a whole. The analyst recommendation score of 2.0 indicates a generally positive sentiment towards the stock. Considering these factors, I allocate 3.5% of the portfolio to NFLX, as it offers a relatively high growth potential with a moderate level of risk."
