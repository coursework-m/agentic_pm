    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a high P/E ratio, but its recent decline in stock price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its advertising business. While the company has a strong track record of innovation, its diversified revenue streams and growing cloud business provide a solid foundation for long-term growth, but the current market conditions and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic make it difficult to justify a buy recommendation."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 3.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong financial position with a high P/E ratio and a growing cloud business. However, its recent decline in stock price may be due to market volatility and concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its business. Microsoft's diversified revenue streams and strong brand provide a solid foundation for long-term growth, but the current market conditions and uncertainty surrounding the pandemic make it difficult to justify a buy recommendation. A hold recommendation is more suitable given the current market conditions."
