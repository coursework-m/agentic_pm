This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the value of the futures contracts underlying the ETN. However, the underlying VIX index has not shown a corresponding increase, indicating that the decline in VXX is not solely due to an increase in volatility. The lack of a direct correlation between the VIX index and the ETN's price suggests that the decline may be due to other factors, such as changes in investor sentiment or positioning. Despite this, the ETN's price has been volatile in recent times, and its value may continue to fluctuate in response to changes in market conditions.",

Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any percentage of the portfolio to this security."
