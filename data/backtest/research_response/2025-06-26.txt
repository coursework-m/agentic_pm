    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{
        "ticker": "...",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "... is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio..."

The lack of recent news and analyst recommendations makes it challenging to determine the underlying reasons for the price movement. However, the VIX index, which the ETN tracks, has been relatively stable, indicating a potential lack of significant market volatility. Given the current market conditions and the lack of fundamental data, it is difficult to make a definitive recommendation. Nevertheless, considering the overall stability of the market and the lack of significant news, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX.",
