After analyzing the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
        "reasoning": "AAPL is showing strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also positive, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may make it less attractive to some investors."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a strong track record of innovation and growth, but its P/E ratio is relatively low compared to its peers. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are mixed, indicating a potential for future growth, but also some concerns about competition and regulation."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong balance sheet and a growing EPS, but its P/E ratio is relatively high compared to its peers. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are positive, indicating a potential for future growth, but also some concerns about competition in the cloud computing market."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for these recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: I have allocated 3.5% of the portfolio to AAPL due to its strong fundamentals, including a high P/E ratio and growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also positive, indicating a potential for future growth. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may make it less attractive to some investors.
* GOOGL: I have not allocated any funds to GOOGL due to its mixed recent news and analyst recommendations. While the company has a strong track record of innovation and growth, its P/E ratio is relatively low compared to its peers, and there are concerns about competition and regulation.
* MSFT: I have allocated 6.0% of the portfolio to MSFT due to its strong balance sheet and growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are positive, indicating a potential for future growth, but also some concerns about competition in the cloud computing market.
