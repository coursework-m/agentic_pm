    You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news. 
    
    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations
        - The Analysis summary

    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{
        "ticker": "...",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,

    }}
    ```
                                 
    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has risen to its highest level in over a year. The VIX index measures market volatility, and its increase suggests that investors are becoming more cautious about the market. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and it may still have some upside potential. However, the current price is relatively low compared to its historical average, making it a potentially attractive buy for those looking to capitalize on the volatility. On the other hand, the lack of analyst recommendations and the absence of any significant news events in the past few days may indicate a lack of confidence in the security.
