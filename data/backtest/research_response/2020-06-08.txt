Based on the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have analyzed each stock and made the following recommendations:

  }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: Apple Inc. has a strong track record of innovation and growth, with a diversified product portfolio and a growing services segment. The recent increase in iPhone sales and the launch of new products indicate a strong demand for Apple's products. Therefore, I recommend allocating 4% of the portfolio to AAPL.
* GOOGL: While GOOGL has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, its dependence on online advertising revenue may be a concern in a changing media landscape. Additionally, the company's Other Bets segment may not be as profitable as expected. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any funds to GOOGL.
* MSFT: MSFT has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, but its dependence on the Windows business may be a concern, and the competition in the software industry is intense. Additionally, the company's recent acquisition of Nuance Communications may not be as profitable as expected. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any funds to MSFT.
