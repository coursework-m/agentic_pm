{
  "ticker": "AMZN",
  "approved": true,
  "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
  "reasoning": "The company's strong fundamentals, including a high price-to-earnings ratio and a beta of 1.314, indicate a relatively high level of volatility. However, the overall sentiment is somewhat bullish, with a positive article from Motley Fool suggesting that the company's growth stocks are undervalued. Additionally, the analyst's recommendation of HOLD suggests that the company's recent news coverage is mixed, but the potential for growth in the e-commerce and cloud computing sectors outweighs the concerns about trade policies. Therefore, I recommend a moderate allocation of 3.5% to AMZN, taking into account the potential for both upside and downside risks."
