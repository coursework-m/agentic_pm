Based on the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have analyzed each stock and made the following recommendations:

```json
[
  {
    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong brand and diverse product portfolio, combined with its attractive EPS and dividend yield, make it an attractive option for investors."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has faced increased competition in the advertising market, which has led to a decline in its stock price. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence provide a solid foundation for long-term growth, the current market conditions make it a less attractive option."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has shown significant growth in its cloud and productivity segments, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure and Office 365 services. The company's strong financials and dividend yield make it an attractive option for investors, and its dependence on the Windows operating system is not a significant concern in the current market."
  }
]
```

My reasoning for each recommendation is as follows:

* AAPL: Apple Inc. has shown resilience in the current market, with a strong brand and diverse product portfolio. The company's recent earnings report showed a slight decline in revenue, but its EPS and dividend yield remain attractive. Analysts expect Apple to continue its growth trajectory, driven by the increasing demand for its products and services. Given its stable performance and attractive fundamentals, I recommend allocating 4% of the portfolio to AAPL.
* GOOGL: Alphabet Inc. has faced increased competition in the advertising market, which has led to a decline in its stock price. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence provide a solid foundation for long-term growth, the current market conditions make it a less attractive option. Given the current market volatility and competition, I do not recommend allocating any funds to GOOGL.
* MSFT: Microsoft Corporation has shown significant growth in its cloud and productivity segments, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure and Office 365 services. The company's strong financials and dividend yield make it an attractive option for investors, and its dependence on the Windows operating system is not a significant concern in the current market. Given its strong fundamentals and growth potential, I recommend allocating 6% of the portfolio to MSFT.
