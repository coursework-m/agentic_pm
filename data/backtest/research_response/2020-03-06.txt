Based on the provided data, I have analyzed each security and made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL is showing strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.53%. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are positive, with a score of 2.08696. The stock has shown a strong upward trend in price and volume, indicating a potential buy opportunity."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a lower P/E ratio and a lower dividend yield compared to AAPL. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are neutral, with a score of 1.58209. The stock has shown a stable price and volume, indicating a hold recommendation."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a high P/E ratio and a high dividend yield of 0.74%. However, the stock has shown a downward trend in price and volume, indicating a potential sell opportunity. Additionally, the analyst recommendation is neutral with a score of 1.41667, which does not support a buy recommendation."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL is showing strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.53%. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are positive, with a score of 2.08696. The stock has shown a strong upward trend in price and volume, indicating a potential buy opportunity. Therefore, I recommend allocating 4% of the portfolio to AAPL.
* GOOGL has a lower P/E ratio and a lower dividend yield compared to AAPL. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are neutral, with a score of 1.58209. The stock has shown a stable price and volume, indicating a hold recommendation. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any funds to GOOGL.
* MSFT has a high P/E ratio and a high dividend yield of 0.74%. However, the stock has shown a downward trend in price and volume, indicating a potential sell opportunity. Additionally, the analyst recommendation is neutral with a score of 1.41667, which does not support a buy recommendation. Therefore, I do not recommend allocating any funds to MSFT.
