The company's fundamentals, including a forward PE ratio of 30.41 and EPS of $27.58, indicate a relatively high valuation. However, the beta of 1.27 suggests that the stock may be somewhat volatile.

Despite this, the company's recent news and headlines have been mixed, with some indicating a slowdown in growth and others highlighting the company's efforts to expand into new markets.

This allocation allows for exposure to the potential upside while managing risk."
