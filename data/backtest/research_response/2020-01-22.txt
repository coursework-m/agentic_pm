After analyzing the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL has a strong track record of innovation and a dominant market position in the smartphone and personal computer markets. The company's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet position it well for long-term growth, despite recent concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending habits."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a strong track record of innovation, but its recent decline in stock price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on advertising revenue. The company's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet position it well for long-term growth, but the current market conditions make it less attractive for investment."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong track record of innovation and a dominant position in the software market. The company's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet position it well for long-term growth, despite recent concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on enterprise software spending. Microsoft's cloud-based services are likely to continue to grow in the long term."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: Apple's strong track record of innovation, dominant market position, and diversified revenue streams make it an attractive investment opportunity. While concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer spending habits may have led to a recent decline in stock price, the company's strong balance sheet position it well for long-term growth.
* GOOGL: Alphabet's strong track record of innovation is not enough to overcome the concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on advertising revenue. The company's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet position it well for long-term growth, but the current market conditions make it less attractive for investment.
* MSFT: Microsoft's strong track record of innovation, dominant position in the software market, and diversified revenue streams make it an attractive investment opportunity. The company's cloud-based services are likely to continue to grow in the long term, making it a good addition to a long-term investment portfolio.
