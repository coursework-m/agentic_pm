    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news. 
    
    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines

        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:

    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
