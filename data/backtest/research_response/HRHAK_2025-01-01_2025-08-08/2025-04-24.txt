    issue an APPROVED/DENIED recommendation for the security.
                                 
    You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news. 
    
    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations
        - The Analysis summary

    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{
        "ticker": "...",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "... is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio..."
    }}
    ```
                                 
    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

  "summary": "Netflix, Inc.'s strong performance in the entertainment industry, driven by its vast content library and global reach, suggests that its fundamentals are solid. The company's high price-to-earnings ratio and forward price-to-earnings ratio indicate investor confidence in its future growth prospects. Additionally, the recent analyst recommendation score of 2.0 indicates a generally positive sentiment among analysts. However, the company's high beta value of 1.589 suggests that its stock may be volatile. The recent news articles, including a somewhat-bullish sentiment from GlobeNewswire and a positive article from Motley Fool, further support the bullish outlook. Overall, considering these factors, I recommend a BUY recommendation for NFLX.",

  "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.89% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has risen to its highest level since 2020. The VIX index is a measure of market volatility, and its increase suggests that investors are becoming more cautious about the market. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and its market capitalization remains relatively stable. However, the overall trend is bearish, and the current price may continue to decline in the near future.",

  "reasoning": "The analyst's recommendation is a sell, which is based on the recent increase in the VIX index and the decline in the ETN's price. The overall trend is bearish, and the current price may continue to decline in the near future. Given the bearish trend and the lack of fundamental data to support a buy, I do not recommend allocating any funds to this security."
