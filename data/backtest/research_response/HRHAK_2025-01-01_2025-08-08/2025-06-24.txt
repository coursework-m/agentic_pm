The company's fundamentals, including a forward PE ratio of 30.41 and EPS of $27.58, suggest that it has a relatively high growth potential. However, the beta of 1.27 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the overall market. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. Despite this, the company's dividend yield of 0.28% is relatively low, which may be a concern for income investors.
