                Here is the Analyst's summary:
{
  "ticker": "VXX",
  "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 4.08% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has risen to its highest level since 2020. The VIX index is a measure of market volatility, and its increase suggests that investors are becoming more cautious about the market. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and its market capitalization remains relatively stable. However, the overall trend is bearish, and the current price may continue to decline in the near future.",
  "recommendation": "SELL"

  "ticker": "VXX",
  "approved": false,
  "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "The analyst's recommendation to SELL is based on the significant decline in the VIX index, which suggests increased market volatility. Although the ETN's market capitalization remains relatively stable, the overall trend is bearish, and the current price has not yet reached its historical lows. Given this bearish trend and the lack of fundamental data to support a buy recommendation, I do not recommend allocating any funds to this security."
