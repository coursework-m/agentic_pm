  "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 1.86% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the demand for VIX futures contracts. However, the underlying VIX index has been trending upwards, indicating a potential rebound in volatility. The lack of analyst recommendations and news related to the security suggests that investors are cautious about the short-term prospects of VXX. Considering these factors, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX, as the potential rebound in volatility could lead to a price increase in the long term.",

  "reasoning": "The security has experienced a significant decline in price due to recent market volatility, but the underlying VIX index is trending upwards, indicating a potential rebound. The lack of analyst recommendations and news suggests caution, but the long-term potential for a price increase makes it a suitable addition to a conservative portfolio with a low allocation percentage."
}
```

Note: I set the target allocation percentage to 2.0% as the security is considered a high-risk, high-reward investment, and a conservative allocation is recommended.
