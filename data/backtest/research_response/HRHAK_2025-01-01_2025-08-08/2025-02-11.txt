    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)

        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:

This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has been rising due to concerns over inflation and interest rates. However, the ETN's price has been volatile in the past, and its value can be affected by various market and economic factors. Despite this, the current price of $42.90 is relatively low compared to its 52-week high of $73.50, indicating a potential buying opportunity. Additionally, the lack of analyst recommendations and news suggests that the market is not overly optimistic about the ETN's prospects, which could lead to a potential rebound.
