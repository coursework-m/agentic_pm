    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines

    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{

    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the value of the futures contracts underlying the ETN. Despite this, the market capitalization of VXX remains relatively stable, indicating that investors are still holding onto the security. However, the lack of fundamental data available for VXX, including PE ratio, forward PE, EPS, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to assess the underlying health of the company. Additionally, the absence of analyst recommendations and news articles suggests that there is limited market sentiment analysis available for this security. Given these factors, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX, as the decline in price may be a temporary correction, and the lack of fundamental data does not provide enough evidence to suggest a strong buy or sell signal.",
