Despite this, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58. The beta of 1.27 indicates a relatively high volatility, but the company's dividend yield of 0.28% suggests a relatively stable income stream. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. However, the recent decline in stock price may be a response to the increasing competition in the social media space and the company's struggles to adapt to the changing user behavior. Overall, the company's fundamentals suggest a HOLD recommendation, but the recent price drop may be a buying opportunity.",
