The neutral sentiment surrounding Anthony Scaramucci's comments about Warren Buffett's caution in 1999 and the potential for AI hype to repeat itself may indicate a potential risk of overvaluation. Additionally, the somewhat-bullish sentiment from President Trump's comments may be overstated, and the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and beta of 1.314 indicate a relatively high level of volatility. Therefore, a conservative approach is recommended, and the security is not recommended for allocation."
