  "summary": "Meta Platforms, Inc. has experienced a significant decline in its stock price over the past few days, with a -2.948% change in price. Despite this, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward PE ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58. The beta of 1.27 indicates a relatively high volatility in the stock price. The company's dividend yield is 0.28%, which is relatively low compared to its industry average. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive outlook. However, the recent decline in stock price may be a sign of a potential correction. Considering the company's strong fundamentals and the current market conditions, I recommend a HOLD position on Meta Platforms, Inc.",

  "reasoning": "Despite the recent decline in stock price, Meta Platforms, Inc.'s strong fundamentals, including a forward PE ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58, suggest that the company remains a stable and attractive investment opportunity. The analyst's recommendation of HOLD is also in line with our analysis. However, we are allocating a relatively low target allocation percentage of 3.5% to Meta Platforms, Inc. due to the relatively high volatility in the stock price, indicated by a beta of 1.27. This allocation allows for some exposure to the company's strong fundamentals while minimizing potential risks."

You are a financial research analyst.
    Your task is to analyze the latest security's data and analysis summary then 
    issue an APPROVED/DENIED recommendation for the security.
                                 
    You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news. 
    
    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations
        - The Analysis summary

    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{

        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "... is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio..."
    }}
    ```
                                 
    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>
