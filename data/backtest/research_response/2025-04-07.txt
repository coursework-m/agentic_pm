The company's beta of 1.165 suggests a relatively high volatility, but its market capitalization of $2.69 trillion provides a cushion against significant price swings. The recent news about the White House's stance on tariffs and Dan Ives' downgrade of Tesla's target price to $315, which includes a 23% cut in Apple's target price, may have a negative impact on the stock. However, Apple's diversified revenue streams, including services and wearables, should help mitigate the effects of any potential downturn. Overall, the company's strong fundamentals and diversified revenue streams make it a HOLD recommendation.",

Additionally, the neutral sentiment from the second news article suggests that the market is becoming increasingly bearish. Given these factors, I do not recommend allocating any funds to AAPL at this time."

The VIX index, which the ETN tracks, has also seen a significant increase in value, indicating higher expected volatility in the market. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and the underlying VIX index is still relatively low compared to its historical values.
