        You are a financial data analyst. Your task is to analyse the security's latest data and issue a
        BUY, HOLD, or SELL recommendation for the security.
        
        You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

        First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals, 
        market data and news. Then, for the security:

        1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
            - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
            - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
            - News and recent headlines
            - Analyst recommendations

        2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.

        Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
        
        Here are my recommendations:

        ```json
        {{

            "summary": "....'s fundamentals are ...",
            "recommendation": "HOLD"

  "summary": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) and Robinhood (HOOD) are currently experiencing a mixed performance, with Alphabet's GOOG and Robinhood's HOOD being the most prominent catalysts.  The company's fundamentals are generally positive, with a strong emphasis on Google Services and Google Cloud.  However, the company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest that the company's future growth prospects are uncertain.  The market is currently leaning towards a potential pullback, with some analysts predicting a potential price decline.  The company's performance is likely to be influenced by the ongoing debate surrounding the future of clean energy and the potential impact of the recent Treasury Department and IRS guidance on tax credit qualifications.  The overall sentiment is likely to be negative, with investors anticipating a potential price decline.  The company's stock price is expected to remain volatile, and the market is likely to react to the news in a range of levels.  The analyst's recommendation is to hold the stock for the current market conditions and to be prepared to adjust its outlook as the market moves.
