    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news. 
    
    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines

    For the security, return:
        - "ticker": the security's ticker symbol
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:

    }}
    ```
                                 
    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security, 
    set "target_allocation_percent" to 0 and provide a clear reasoning for the denial.

Apple's beta of 1.165 indicates it's slightly more volatile than the market. Recent news highlights an admission of flaws in their AI news summarization feature, which is a negative development and could impact user trust.

  "summary": "Amazon's fundamentals show a high P/E ratio (33.95) and a forward P/E of 36.21, suggesting the stock may be overvalued relative to its earnings. The company operates in a competitive sector (Consumer Cyclical, Internet Retail) and has a beta of 1.314, indicating it's slightly more volatile than the market.

  "ticker": "AMZN",
  "approved": true,
  "target_allocation_percent": 2.5,
  "reasoning": "While the analyst summary flags a high P/E ratio and suggests potential overvaluation, the recent news regarding the Ring smart smoke alarms indicates continued innovation and expansion within Amazon's ecosystem. The beta of 1.314 suggests moderate volatility, which is acceptable for a small allocation. The HOLD recommendation from the analyst suggests a cautious approach, aligning with a conservative portfolio strategy. Given the current market conditions and the potential for future growth within Amazon's diverse business segments, a small allocation is warranted."

The forward P/E is slightly lower at 50.95, but still elevated. The EPS of $23.49 is respectable, but doesn't fully justify the premium valuation.

  "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
  "reasoning": "While the analyst summary indicates a 'HOLD' recommendation, the high P/E ratio of 51.58 and a beta of 1.589 raise concerns about the stock's valuation and volatility. The news sentiment is mixed, with a bullish article about Black Enterprise and a somewhat-bullish article about TKO Group Holdings, but neither directly relates to Netflix's performance or outlook. Considering the current market conditions and the elevated valuation, a low allocation is not warranted at this time."
