    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 5.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL has a strong track record of innovation, a loyal customer base, and a recent acquisition of AMD, which is a positive sign of its growth strategy. However, the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and increasing competition in the smartphone market may pose some risks. Considering these factors, I recommend allocating 5% of the portfolio to AAPL."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a high price-to-earnings ratio and its dependence on online advertising revenue, which may pose significant risks. Additionally, the company's slow growth rate in recent years and increasing competition from social media platforms may indicate a potential correction. Considering these factors, I do not recommend allocating any funds to GOOGL."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 10.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong track record of innovation, a growing cloud computing business, and a recent acquisition of GitHub, which are positive signs of its growth strategy. However, the company's high price-to-earnings ratio and its dependence on the Windows operating system may pose some risks. Considering these factors, I recommend allocating 10% of the portfolio to MSFT."
