Elon Musk's leadership of the DOGE initiative for the Trump administration has thrown Tesla Inc TSLA into the center of a global political storm. 
Once a symbol of innovation, the electric vehicle company now finds itself at the heart of controversy, with protests erupting at dealerships, vehicles vandalized, and a massive ""TeslaTakedown"" day of action planned for Saturday, March 29. 
Musk faces a defining crisis as tensions boil over—can he steer Tesla through the chaos and reclaim control of the brand's future? Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives bets he can. 
On Thursday, Ives reiterated Tesla with an Outperform rating and a $550 price target.

Ives expects a soft, rip-the-band-aid-off first-quarter delivery number to hit on April 2. If deliveries fall within the 355,000 to 360,000 range, that’s down roughly 7%. For context, original Street estimates were over 400,000 to start the quarter and have decreased drastically as the weekly global data has weakened. 
Europe’s numbers are under significant pressure, with demand softness also seen in the U.S. and China.
Much of this softness is related to customers waiting for Model Y refreshes. Also, Tesla expects to launch a new lower-cost model by the summer. However, anti-Musk and brand issues are clearly at play and significant in this weak first-quarter delivery number.
Ives estimated that 30% of the very soft first-quarter delivery number is related to Musk, the brand, and DOGE. About 70% is more timing and non-brand headwind issues.
“It has been a tumultuous few months for Musk and Tesla as investors have navigated a very stormy backdrop with Tesla becoming a lightning rod of controversy,” Ives wrote. Musk’s DOGE initiative has “essentially taken on a life of its own” and turned Tesla into “a political symbol globally with protests, violence and demonstrations at dealerships and cars keyed,” he added. 
Ives expects the first quarter to be the “low point.” The Street is reviewing the numbers to better understand the delivery trajectory for the rest of the year. 
That depends on whether Musk can balance being Tesla’s CEO and running DOGE. Ives says investors and employees yearn for Musk’s leadership at this juncture. 
Musk recently held an all-hands meeting, and the stock has recovered somewhat. The analyst noted that perhaps investors are starting to sense a potential turning point in this latest Tesla chapter.
Musk also impressed Ives with Tesla’s long-term strategic vision, which includes autonomous vehicles and robotics.
So far, Musk has guided Tesla towards Austin’s unsupervised full self-driving, or FSD. The Cybercab also debuted. 
Plus, a lower-cost vehicle launch and more Model 3/Y refreshes, autonomous and robotics/Optimus technology improvements “set the stage for a new era of growth.”
“This continues to be a moment of truth for Musk to navigate this brand tornado crisis moment and get onto the other side of this dark chapter for Tesla with much better days ahead we see for the story,” Ives said. 
Ives projected first-quarter revenue of $24.05 billion and EPS of 56 cents.
Price Action: Tesla stock is up 2.6% at $279.12 at last check Thursday. It’s down over 26.4% year-to-date.

TSLA,Trump Slaps 25% Tariffs On Autos: What It Means For Your Next Car Purchase - General Motors  ( NYSE:GM ) ,20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.174697,"Price increases are expected across the board, affecting new and used cars, maintenance costs and even insurance premiums. Electric vehicle prices could rise by as much as $12,200 once the tariffs are in effect. Feel unsure about the market's next move?",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/03/44517885/trump-slaps-25-tariffs-on-autos-what-it-means-for-your-next-car-purchase,"Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.
Car prices surged during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Experts are now warning consumers to prepare for additional price hikes due to President Donald Trump's new 25% tariff on imported vehicles and certain auto parts. 
What To Know: President Trump announced the tariffs on Tuesday evening, saying they will “charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth,” and claiming they will “spur growth like you haven't seen before.” 
Experts predict these tariffs will lead to tighter supply and higher prices by mid-April.

“You’re going to see price increases,” Ivan Drury, director of insights at automotive research site Edmunds, told USA Today. “It’s such a shotgun approach. Virtually nothing goes unscathed.”  
Price increases are expected across the board, affecting new and used cars, maintenance costs and even insurance premiums as the cost of replacement parts will also go up. 
New vehicle prices have gone up approximately 25% since early 2020, according to the Kelley Blue Book, with the average price for a new car just above $48,000 as of February 2025. 
According to estimates from the Anderson Economic Group, electric vehicle prices could rise by as much as $12,200 once the tariffs are in effect. Tesla, Inc. TSLA EVs could see similar price hikes as the automaker relies heavily on imported batteries and electronics. 
Wedbush analyst Dan Ives remained hopeful in a note written Wednesday that the auto tariffs are a negotiation tool and will be revised in the coming weeks. 
However, Ives said the tariffs in their current form “would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many US) automakers” and could raise the average car price by $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the make and model. 
Why It Matters: While the tariffs might encourage U.S. manufacturing investment in the long term, consumers will face immediate price challenges. Shares of the Big Three U.S. automakers’ stocks are also suffering, with Ford Motor Co. F, Stellantis N.V. STLA and General Motors Co. GM all down sharply on Trump's tariff plans. 
Most experts agree that consumers who were considering purchasing a vehicle may now want to move sooner than later as prices are expected to rise. 
""If you were thinking about buying in the next couple of years, it might not be a bad idea to make that purchase now if you can afford it,"" Monica Dwyer, a certified financial planner, told CNBC.

What To Know: Trump on Wednesday revealed a 25% tariff on imported cars and key auto parts, according to CNBC.
The tariff on imported vehicles will take effect on April 3, while the tariff on auto parts will begin by May 3. However, auto parts compliant with the USMCA agreement will remain tariff-free until the commerce secretary and U.S. Customs and Border Protection coordinate the logistics of applying tariffs to non-U.S. content.
Shares of Ford, along with other automakers like General Motors Company GM and Toyota Motor Corporation TM, are moving lower following this announcement, as these companies rely on imported parts to manufacture their vehicles. The tariffs could raise the cost of those imports, potentially impacting their profit margins.
Deutsche Bank analysts noted that, “Tesla and Ford appear to be the most shielded given location of vehicle assembly facilities although Ford does face incremental exposure on imported engines.”
Goldman Sachs analysts estimate that this tariff could increase the price of imported cars by $5,000 to $15,000.

Launched in October 2024, XMAG has quickly emerged as a game-changing tool for investors seeking to diversify and manage concentration risk in a market rattled by the Mag 7 crash.
Unlike traditional S&P 500 funds, XMAG tracks the BITA US 500 ex-Magnificent 7 Index, offering exposure to the largest 500 U.S. equities while deliberately excluding the Mag 7. This strategic design has paid off handsomely this year, delivering robust returns and stability at a time when overexposure to these tech titans has dragged down broader market performance. As the S&P 500 struggles under the weight of the Mag 7's decline, XMAG stands out as a core replacement for large-cap exposure—a direct, smarter alternative to the S&P 500.
""Investors and advisors have long been overexposed to the Magnificent 7 through mutual funds, ETFs, and individual stock portfolios,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and CIO of Defiance ETFs. ""This year's market dynamics have exposed the risks of that concentration, and XMAG has proven its worth as a powerful solution. It's not just about dodging the Mag 7 crash—it's about delivering diversified, resilient returns that redefine large-cap investing.""
With the Mag 7's dominance waning, XMAG offers a timely and effective way to rebalance portfolios, reduce risk, and capture the strength of the broader U.S. equity market. Its performance in 2025 underscores its role as an essential tool for advisors and investors looking to pivot away from tech-heavy strategies and embrace a more balanced approach to growth.
""XMAG isn't a niche play—it's a core holding,"" Jablonski added. ""It's the diversification investors have been craving, and the results speak for themselves. As the market evolves, XMAG is setting a new standard for large-cap exposure.""

In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
Bulls currently have SPY trading near the critical pivot of 567.81. For a bullish scenario, a decisive move higher through 569.16 is crucial. Sustained buying above 569.98 could provide enough strength to target a rally towards 571.06. If buyers successfully defend this mark, expect continuation to the upside targeting 572.15, with an ambitious upside goal of 573.50. 
If SPY struggles and fails to maintain support at 567.81, bearish momentum would likely emerge, pushing prices down initially toward 566.46. Persistent selling pressure at this level could open the path to lower support zones at 565.38, followed by a critical test at 564.29. A heavy sell-off scenario today may extend prices down to our bearish objective at 563.23.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
QQQ is currently trading near the pivotal 481.73 level. For the bullish narrative to unfold, buyers must clearly establish dominance above this mark, followed by a firm move toward 483.95. Continued positive momentum should support an advance toward 486.10, potentially driving prices higher to test 487.69. If the bullish scenario plays out robustly, the day’s bullish target stands at 490.05. 
However, if buyers cannot maintain strength at 481.73, bears will likely seize control and press downward to test support at 479.03. Increasing bearish sentiment would likely prompt further selling toward 476.85, with subsequent downside continuation to a key support zone at 474.66. Should selling intensity increase, a drop towards our bearish goal at 471.33 becomes probable.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is trading near the key reference point of 220.29. For bullish traders, securing support above this mark is essential, potentially driving price action toward 220.97. Persistent upward momentum may fuel further bullish expansion toward 221.66, ultimately challenging the higher resistance area marked at our bullish target of 222.24. 
Conversely, failure to defend the level of 220.29 may activate bearish sentiment, prompting an initial sell-off toward 219.19. If bearish momentum accelerates, anticipate a deeper decline to support around 218.08, and further selling could extend the downside pressure to test 216.70. A sustained bearish environment may ultimately guide the price to our bearish objective at 215.25.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft's current price action revolves closely around our benchmark at 389.29. For bullish sentiment to remain intact, bulls must decisively defend this area and push upward toward the next resistance level of 390.98. Holding this level through regular trading hours could stimulate additional upward movement toward 392.49, and continued bullish activity may reach our primary bullish target of 393.47. 
If bulls fail to support price at 389.29, bearish traders could aggressively target initial downside at 388.53. Should this support fail, expect additional bearish momentum driving prices lower towards 387.60, and potentially extending further downward to 386.09. Under persistent selling pressure, the day’s bearish target for Microsoft is set at 385.42.
NVIDIA Corporation NVDA
NVIDIA is actively trading near our significant pivot at 111.70. Bullish participants will need to convincingly push through initial resistance at 112.54, firmly establishing support there to encourage upside continuation toward 113.68. Increased bullish strength may support a rally up to 114.29, with a bullish scenario setting sights on the primary bullish objective of 115.15. 
On the flip side, a breakdown below the key support level of 111.70 would open the possibility of bearish acceleration toward 110.73. A continuation of selling pressure could drive prices down further, testing 109.86. Additional weakness may prompt bears to push the auction even lower towards 109.12, with today’s bearish target resting at 107.51.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is trading closely near our significant pivot of 165.41. Bulls must defend this area effectively, enabling upward momentum toward initial resistance at 167.04. Continued bullish sentiment could propel prices further upwards, aiming at our primary bullish target today set at 169.34. 
Alternatively, a failure to hold support at 165.41 could initiate bearish activity pushing prices down towards the next key support level at 163.79. If bearish pressure remains intense, expect further decline toward 161.79. Sustained downside momentum could ultimately guide price toward our bearish objective today at 160.36.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is currently trading near the pivotal level of 604.50. Bulls will look to sustain support above this critical area, setting the stage for an initial bullish test at 609.30. Continued buying could further energize the auction towards 615.65, with a robust bullish environment potentially reaching our high bullish target today of 622.01. 
Should support at 604.50 fail during today’s session, bearish traders will likely drive prices downward toward the next key area at 598.17. If bearish sentiment intensifies, look for additional declines reaching 591.29. A deeper breakdown could eventually lead Meta's price action toward the bearish target today at 585.73.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is presently trading close to our essential reference point at 275.07. Bulls will aim for decisive upward momentum targeting initial resistance at 278.11. Sustained bullish sentiment could carry prices higher toward our next key level at 279.43, potentially advancing further toward 281.32. If buyer interest is particularly robust today, the ultimate bullish objective is established at 283.95. 
Conversely, should the 275.07 support level fail, anticipate immediate bearish pressure toward 272.42. Continued selling intensity could further pressure prices downwards, testing lower at 269.48. If bearish momentum deepens significantly, a further decline toward today's bearish target of 266.83 is likely.
Final Word:
Today’s trading environment is heavily influenced by key economic data, beginning with Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM ET, released concurrently with Advance Goods Trade Balance and Retail Inventories for February, along with the significant Q4 GDP Annualized Price Index (Third Reading). Later at 10 AM ET, Pending Home Sales data for February arrives, providing additional market-moving potential. Additionally, watch for the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity Index for March at 11:00 AM ET, followed by a crucial 7-Year Treasury Note Auction at 1 PM ET. 
Given the breadth and significance of today's economic releases, heightened volatility is anticipated across markets. Traders should approach today’s session prepared, emphasizing risk management and strategic patience, as data-driven price action could lead to considerable swings. Stay disciplined, and trade safe!

TSLA,"Commerce Secretary Lutnick Promoting Tesla On Fox News: 'We're All Going To Be Buying $30,000 Tesla Robots.' Anyone Who Doesn't Is 'Silly' - Tesla  ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) ",20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.150385,"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is publicly backing Tesla TSLA and its CEO, Elon Musk, on TV, sparking a wave of criticism from ethics experts, investors and public figures, including Tesla bull Gary Black.",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/news/25/03/44514806/commerce-secretary-lutnick-promoting-tesla-on-fox-news-were-all-going-to-be-buying-30000-tesla-robots-anyone,"Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick is publicly backing Tesla TSLA and its CEO, Elon Musk, on TV, sparking a wave of criticism from ethics experts, investors and public figures, including Tesla bull Gary Black.
During a recent appearance on Fox News, Lutnick lavished praise on Musk, calling him “probably the best person to bet on I’ve ever met.” He claimed Tesla stock is massively undervalued and urged viewers to buy in. “It’ll never be this cheap again,” Lutnick said, adding that people will one day regret not purchasing Musk’s stock.
Lutnick: We are all going to be buying robots. They are going to cost around $30,000, you're going to be buying a Tesla robot and anybody who does not buy a Tesla robot is going to be silly. pic.twitter.com/f5coSJZPaY
Don't Miss:
He went a step further, promoting Tesla’s upcoming humanoid robot Optimus, which he said would sell for about $30,000. “Anybody who does not have a Tesla robot will be silly,” Lutnick said. “They will mow our lawn and make us coffee and our bed… and renovate our bathroom. I’m telling you, we’re both going to have really nice bathrooms.”
Lutnick also promoted Musk’s robotaxi project, the Cybercab, suggesting both products would soon be part of everyday life.
But even Musk himself has recently tried to lower the hype. In November, he said on X that a $30,000 price tag for either product would only be possible in the “long-term” and that Tesla would need to reach production volumes of over 1 million units per year. He did not clarify if that target applied individually or combined.
Trending: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm — invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now.
Musk had previously said Optimus would be sold below $30,000 and that there could be one robot per person in the future. Still, he acknowledged earlier that only limited factory use is expected in 2025, with possible wider rollout by 2026. As for the Cybercab, it is still slated for production “before 2027.”
Ethics watchdogs have voiced concern about Lutnick's public endorsements of Tesla.
“It’s an ethics issue, and it’s an optics issue,” said Jordan Libowitz, head of communications at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. “When someone spends hundreds of millions of dollars to elect a president and then that president's administration takes action that appears to be an attempt to boost that person's net worth.”
Richard Painter, ethics counsel under President George W. Bush, was even more direct: “The Commerce Secretary is not Jim Cramer.”
President Donald Trump has also repeatedly praised Musk and Tesla, recently posing in front of Teslas on the White House lawn and pledging to buy a Model S.

Even Tesla bulls like Gary Black are cautioning against inflated expectations. Black, managing partner of The Future Fund, estimates that 500,000 Optimus robots by 2027 would add just $0.70 to Tesla's earnings per share.
“Every time I try to right-size expectations, I get pounded on by TSLA uberbulls,” he said on X. “TSLA has underperformed for the past three years because expectations were too high.”
He pointed out that Tesla's 2025 and 2026 earnings estimates have dropped 39% and 45%, respectively, over the past year.
Meanwhile, Bank of America values the Optimus segment at between $14 billion and $95 billion but sees greater long-term potential in Tesla's robotaxi and self-driving technology, which it says could eventually make up more than 75% of Tesla's value.

TSLA,"Here's what Elon Musk, the UAW and industry figures are saying about Trump's auto tariffs",20250327,Neutral,-0.014486,President Donald Trump signed an order to implement a 25% tariff on auto imports. Pool via AP This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now.,Business Insider,www.businessinsider.com,https://www.businessinsider.com/auto-tariffs-trump-responses-elon-musk-uaw-industry-figures-2025-3,"President Donald Trump finally announced 25% tariffs on auto imports on Wednesday, which he said would push automakers to expand production in the US.
Here's what industry figures and politicians are saying about the decision. 
The United Auto Workers union praised the move it said would help reverse more than 30 years of free trade policies that had devastated the US auto industry.
""Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today's actions,"" UAW president Shawn Fain said in a statement.
The union expects the tariffs will push automakers, including the Big Three of GM, Ford and Stellantis as well as foreign companies such as Volkswagen, to invest more in the US and potentially create thousands of jobs.
The union argued that underutilized plants could quickly scale up production, reversing thousands of layoffs they attributed to the outsourcing to Mexico.
While Tesla produces its cars in the US, CEO Elon Musk said on X the tariffs would still have a ""significant"" impact on his EV company meaning it was ""not unscathed here.""
""To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries,"" he posted on Wednesday, adding that the cost impact is ""not trivial.""
The tariffs come as Tesla faces challenges including US registrations falling by 11% in January and European sales sliding 42% in January and February.
Japan, the second-largest exporter of vehicles to the US after Mexico, warned of a strong response. Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said ""every option"" was under consideration, and his government called the tariffs ""extremely regrettable"" and a threat to bilateral relations.
South Korea's industry minister, Ahn Duk-Geun, said Korean automakers faced ""considerable difficulties"" and would announce emergency measures.
European automakers also sounded the alarm. The European Automobile Manufacturers' Association warned that tariffs would hurt both global automakers and US domestic manufacturing, as European manufacturers export 50% to 60% of the cars they make in the US.
""We urge President Trump to consider the negative impact of tariffs not only on global automakers but on US domestic manufacturing as well,"" said the association's director-general Sigrid de Vries in a statement sent to Business Insider.
European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she ""deeply regretted"" the US decision to impose tariffs, while UK finance minister Rachel Reeves said Britain would not escalate trade tensions.
While Honda produces most of its cars for the American market in the US, rivals including Toyota, Nissan, Hyundai/Kia, Volkswagen, and Stellantis rely heavily on imports, making them particularly exposed to the tariffs.
Autos Drive America, representing foreign automakers like Honda and Toyota, warned the tariffs would lead to higher car prices, fewer choices for consumers, and job losses.
""The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers, and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US,"" said Jennifer Safavian, the CEO of Autos Drive America.

TSLA,Trump escalates his trade war with new tariffs,20250327,Neutral,0.046294,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Good morning. One homeowner has the chance to live above the clouds. A penthouse in the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, is on the market for $49 million.",Business Insider,www.businessinsider.com,https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-new-tariffs-auto-industry-trade-war-escalate-tesla-ford-2025-3,"Good morning. One homeowner has the chance to live above the clouds. A penthouse in the Burj Khalifa, the world's tallest building, is on the market for $49 million. The Dubai-based listing agent told BI he's surprised at how many calls he's gotten from interested Americans.
In today's big story, President Donald Trump's trade war just intensified.
What's on deck
Markets: Two major banks slashed their stock-market outlooks for 2025.
Tech: Googlers grilled leaders about smaller pay bumps in an all-hands.
Business: Americans are shoplifting at Whole Foods — and they don't feel bad about it.
But first, it was a rough day for the markets.
If this was forwarded to you, sign up here.
The trade war has escalated.
On Wednesday, Trump announced plans to impose sweeping 25% tariffs on cars from overseas.
The president suggested the new tariff could boost manufacturing growth in the US if foreign-owned auto companies add new plants in the country to get around the import fees.
""A lot of foreign car companies are going to be in great shape because they've already built their plant, but their plants are underutilized, so they'll be able to expand them inexpensively and quickly,"" Trump said. ""Others will come into our country and build, and they're already looking for sites.""
The markets weren't happy.
Shares of Ford and General Motors were sharply lower in after-hours trading following the announcement. Tesla was also down, building on a 6% drop earlier in the day amid a broad selloff.
Tech shares took a hit, too, amid the expectation that more cautious corporate activity will eventually erode earnings growth market-wide.
Investors had cheered earlier in the week amid reports that Trump could soften the tariffs due to kick in on April 2.
I doubt they're cheering this morning. Trump warned today that he plans to impose additional ""large scale tariffs"" on the European Union and Canada if they collaborate to do ""economic harm"" to the US.
1. Last year's rainmakers may need to ditch the umbrellas. Wall Street made it rain in 2024 as bonuses reached a record $47.5 billion, according to a report from the New York state comptroller. But the comptroller warned that those celebrations may be fleeting.
2. Two more big banks slash market outlook. HSBC downgraded its rating of US stocks, citing falling confidence. Meanwhile, Barclays cut its S&P 500 target to the lowest among major banks, predicting the index will finish the year at 5,900.
3. Nvidia stock tumbles. The chip giant's stock fell by nearly 6% on Wednesday, following a report that Beijing introduced new energy efficiency rules that would effectively remove Nvidia's H20 chip from the Chinese market. The restrictions pose a direct threat to the company's business in the country.
1. TikTok's US e-commerce team is having a terrible time. ByteDance's CEO put the team behind TikTok Shop on blast during a global all-hands, nine current and former employees told BI. It also trimmed down the team in March with a PIP-or-severance process.
2. Googlers grill leaders over pay. Employees recently got their new compensation packages, and some say they've seen a decrease. Staff asked why some had seen smaller pay bumps despite the company's recent strong financial performance during an all-hands on Tuesday, according to a transcript of the meeting shared with BI.
3. This healthcare startup is set to be valued over $300 million. Solace, which matches Medicare patients with clinical professionals in all 50 states, just raised a fresh round of funding led by Menlo Ventures, BI has learned. Before its Series B, it had raised $21 million.
1. Is it still shoplifting if you're stealing from Jeff Bezos? ""If a billionaire can steal from me, I can scrape a little off the top, too."" That's how one person justifies stealing little goodies from Whole Foods. Others are fudging Amazon returns. But small-time swiping could be causing unintended harm.
2. Signalgate's workplace lesson. The dustup following US officials' use of Signal to discuss military operations is a good example of what not to do when you mess up at work. Executives told BI owning up to a mistake is best, and it's a good opportunity for leaders to pass along lessons to the entire organization.
3. FCC aims at Disney. Brendan Carr, chairman of the FCC, said he plans to investigate Disney's DEI practices after similar announcements about Comcast and Verizon. Trump, who appointed Carr, has made it clear he considers many media companies his enemies, and Carr has suggested their broadcast licenses could be at stake.

The stocks of automakers, General Motors Co. GM, Ford Inc. F, Stellantis NV STLA and Tesla Inc. TSLA declined 5.79%, 3.69%, 2.58%, and 1.59%, respectively during the pre-market trading session on Thursday.
What Happened: On Wednesday, a 25% tariff was imposed by President Donald Trump on foreign-made automobiles, citing that automotive imports still pose a threat to the country’s industrial base and national security.  
Following the announcement, the Nasdaq 100 fell into the correction zone once again, dropping 10.38% from its 52-week high. The S&P 500 index was down 7.08% from its record levels, while the Dow Jones was 5.81% lower from its 52-week high. Auto stocks were the most impacted and the sell-off continues in today’s pre-market trading. 
During a press conference, Trump, when questioned about the market decline following a three-day rise, emphasized that his focus was on job creation, not the stock market. “That can take care of itself in one day, two days, or one week,” he stated.  “That can take care of itself in one day, two days, or one week,” he stated.
The Trump administration contends that automakers have surplus capacity for domestic production and were aware of possible tariffs.
SEE ALSO: Discord Prepares For Potential IPO With Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan: Report
Why It Matters: According to the Associated Press, the tariffs, expected to generate $100 billion per year, will take effect on April 3. Trump maintains that tariffs will be instrumental in bringing back auto manufacturing into the U.S. However, experts opine that it will take years to witness this positive impact, as it takes more than 3 years to set up an auto plant and shift production.
The latest auto tariffs have rattled the auto sector. CNBC’s auto sector expert Phil LeBeau stated that more than 7 million vehicles could be impacted by these tariffs and it could drive the auto sector into recession. Even Tesla CEO Elon Musk accepted that this tariff will have a significant impact on Tesla despite domestic manufacturing, because some parts are still imported from other countries, particularly China.
Weighing in on the possibilities of car price hikes, Wedbush analysts told Reuters, “In our view these initial tariffs (if they hold in their current form) would be a hurricane-like headwind to foreign (and many U.S.) automakers and ultimately push the average price of cars up $5,000 to $10,000.”

Cathie Wood, the star stock picker behind Tesla’s stratospheric valuation, has doubled down on her bets, citing the convergence of artificial intelligence (AI), new energy and automation for her bullishness.
The worldwide market for self-driving taxis, which Tesla is approved to test in California, is set to skyrocket, the founder and CEO of Ark Investment Management said.
“We think US$8 [trillion] to US$10 trillion for the entire autonomous taxi opportunity throughout the world, from almost nothing,” is possible, Wood said at HSBC’s Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong on Thursday. “That’s how quickly AI is going to cause these things to happen.”
Wood predicted earlier this week in a media interview that Tesla’s robotaxis would account for 90 per cent of its value of US$2,600 per share in the next five years.
AI would cause all kinds of convergence among sectors, creating a “huge opportunity”, she added.
Tesla was an example of the convergence of various sectors, Wood said. “We did not define it as an auto company. It was a robotics, energy storage and AI company.”"

The U.S. auto industry is on the brink of a significant shakeup as a 25% tariff on imported vehicles looms, according to an industry expert.
What Happened: Phil LeBeau, CNBC’s auto and airline industry expert, recently shed light on the potential consequences of a 25% tariff introduced by President Donald Trump on imported vehicles. With 7.38 million imported vehicles sold in the U.S. last year, the magnitude of the market that could be affected by such tariffs is substantial.
LeBeau argues that implementing a 25% tariff on all 7.38 million imported vehicles is impractical given the consistent consumer demand. He anticipates that automakers will respond in various ways, including scaling down production at overseas plants that supply the U.S. market, increasing vehicle prices, and cutting buyer incentives to balance the tariff costs.
Trump has stated that domestic plants currently operate at roughly 60% capacity and onshoring would help boost the capacity. However, LeBeau feels it cannot be an overnight process, stating that automakers will also have to assess their ability to shift production to the U.S., a complex process involving new tooling and supply chain adjustments.
The auto expert stressed that constructing a new auto plant would take at least two and a half to three and a half years, even at an expedited pace.

Why It Matters: The 25% tariff on auto imports was introduced by Trump to stimulate domestic production, but it could financially burden automakers reliant on international supply chains. Elon Musk has also warned that Tesla Inc. TSLA will face a significant impact due to these tariffs, as the company imports parts from other countries, particularly China. 
Adding another layer to the conversation, President Trump has floated the idea of making interest on auto loans tax-deductible for buyers of American-made vehicles. LeBeau acknowledged this could mitigate some consumer pain, appealing to buyers facing potential price hikes. 
However, with average vehicle transaction prices nearing $49,000, a tariff-driven increase of $4,000 could push costs above $52,000-$53,000, potentially offsetting the tax benefit's impact. “It is an attractive thing to make the interest rate tax deductible but you are also gonna be looking at higher cost,” stated Phil LeBeau.
An auto industry executive warned LeBeau,” This is going to drive the auto industry, not the overall economy, strictly the auto industry into recession.”
On Wednesday, shares of major automakers like Stellantis NV STLA and General Motors GM fell 3.5% and 3%, respectively, following tariff discussions. Meanwhile, Tesla stock dropped 5.58% to close at $272.06.

Key Points
Billionaire Bill Ackman is the CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management, a hedge fund that returned 210% in the past five years. Comparatively, the S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.21%) advanced 101% during the same period. Those market-beating results make Ackman a good source of inspiration for individual investors.
Since January, Ackman has bought more than 30 million shares in a robotaxi stock that has soared 145% in the past two years. I'm not referring to Tesla, though the company also plans to launch an autonomous ride-sharing service in Austin this year. Instead, the stock Pershing Square has been buying is Uber Technologies (UBER 0.63%).
Here's what investors should know.
Uber operates the largest ride-sharing service and second-largest restaurant food delivery service in the U.S. as measured by revenue, according to Bloomberg. The company is also the ride-share leader in nine other countries and the food-delivery leader in seven countries.
That scale affords Uber an important competitive advantage. It makes the network effect inherent to its business particularly powerful, such that monthly active users increased 14% and trips increased 19% last year. That means the number of users in not only increasing, but also those users are engaging the platform more frequently.
Scale also supports cost-efficient user acquisition because Uber can market mobility services to delivery app consumers and vice versa. The company is exploiting that opportunity: 31% of first-time delivery trips come from the mobility app, and 22% of first-time mobility trips come from the delivery app.
Finally, the company is deepening its consumer relationships through product innovation and the Uber One membership program. Last year, multiproduct adoption reached a record 37% of consumers, and Uber One members increased 60% to 30 million people.
Uber's leadership in the ride-sharing market means it can effectively aggregate demand for companies with autonomous vehicle (AV) fleets. CEO Dana Khosrowshahi told analysts on the fourth-quarter earnings call, ""Uber is uniquely positioned to offer tremendous value for AV players looking to deploy their technology at scale.""
Uber has already partnered with 14 autonomous driving technology companies, including Alphabet's Waymo. That particular partnership dates back to October 2023, when Uber began matching riders with Waymo robotaxis in Phoenix. The partnership expanded in April 2024, when Uber Eats started using Waymos for autonomous food delivery.
In March 2025, the companies collaborated to bring robotaxis to Austin -- that may have been a shot at Tesla given that its corporate headquarters is in Austin. Uber and Waymo also plan to launch robotaxis in Atlanta in the coming months. If those partnerships prove fruitful for both parties, it would underscore what CEO Dana Khosrowshahi has said about Uber being ""an indispensable partner for AV players.""
Going forward, Uber believes autonomous ride-sharing will be a $1 trillion market in the U.S. alone. So, when accounting for its global scale, Uber has a multitrillion-dollar market opportunity in robotaxis.

Uber reported solid financial results in the fourth quarter. Revenue increased 20% to $12 billion on particularly strong sales growth in the mobility segment. Additionally, adjusted EBITDA increased 44% to $1.8 billion as take rate improved across the mobility and delivery segments, meaning the company kept more of each dollar spent on its platform.
Turning to the future, Uber estimates annual adjusted EBITDA growth will range from high-30% to 40% over the next three years. That hints at similar growth in adjusted earnings, which makes the current valuation of 17 times earnings look very reasonable. Investors should feel comfortable buying a small position in this brilliant robotaxi stock today.

TSLA,US robotics firms push for national strategy to compete with China,20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.309381,"Tesla, Boston Dynamics and others are pushing for US policies that would boost American companies in the global robotics race.",South China Morning Post,www.scmp.com,https://www.scmp.com/tech/policy/article/3304088/us-robotics-firms-push-national-strategy-compete-china,"Tesla, Boston Dynamics and others are pushing for US policies that would boost American companies in the global robotics race
Representatives of companies – including Tesla, Boston Dynamics and Agility Robotics – on Wednesday met lawmakers in Washington to show off products and push for the US to adopt policies that would boost American companies in a global race to develop the next generation of robots.
Jeff Cardenas, co-founder and CEO of humanoid start-up Apptronik, of Austin, Texas, pointed out to lawmakers that it was American carmaker General Motors that deployed the first industrial robot at a New Jersey assembly plant in 1961. But the US then ceded its early lead to Japan, which remains a powerhouse of industrial robotics, along with Europe.
The next robotics race would be powered by artificial intelligence (AI) and would be “anybody’s to win”, Cardenas said in an interview after the closed-door meeting. “I think the US has a great chance of winning. We’re leading in AI, and I think we’re building some of the best robots in the world. But we need a national strategy if we’re going to continue to build and stay ahead.”
The Association for Advanced Automation said a national strategy would help US companies scale production and drive the adoption of robots as the “physical manifestation” of AI. The group made it clear that China and several other countries already had a plan in place."

What Happened: According to a report by CTV News, Ford urged Prime Minister Mark Carney to convene a first ministers’ meeting following Trump’s announcement.
Ford, speaking at Queen's Park on Wednesday, emphasized a “tariff for tariff” approach, while awaiting Trump’s actions on April 2.
""I do not want to hurt other provinces, but I can assure you one thing, we're going to make sure that we inflict as much pain as possible to the American people without inflicting pain on the Canadian population,"" Ford added.

He has been vocal since the trade tensions began in February, even threatening to cut off electricity to certain U.S. states. Ford has also engaged with American media and met with U.S. Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick.
Ford has requested Carney to gather the premiers early next week to strategize a “team Canada approach” before the auto levy is enacted. He aims to minimize harm to Canadians while maximizing impact on the U.S.

Ford plans to meet with auto sector leaders to discuss the potential implications of Trump’s tariffs, expressing skepticism about the feasibility of implementing such measures by April 2. He reiterated the need for Canada to stand firm against U.S. trade actions.
Why It Matters: The proposed 25% tariff on auto imports by President Donald Trump has stirred significant controversy and concern both domestically and internationally.
The tariffs are expected to generate $100 billion annually and are intended to boost U.S. domestic production. However, this move could financially strain automakers that rely heavily on international supply chains.
The impact of these tariffs is not limited to the U.S. Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc. TSLA, has warned of a “significant” impact on the company due to the tariffs. Despite manufacturing vehicles domestically, Tesla imports parts from other countries, particularly China, which could lead to increased costs.
Economists and market analysts have also expressed concerns over the potential economic fallout of these tariffs. The tariffs could lead to higher car prices and put upward pressure on interest rates, potentially pushing the economy towards a recession.

Why It's Important: China leads the global market for industrial robots, with approximately 1.8 million machines in operation across factories and other sectors in 2023, according to the Germany-based International Federation of Robotics.
Earlier this week, it was reported that China’s Agibot plans to produce 5,000 robots in 2025, directly competing with Elon Musk’s Optimus.
Nvidia Corporation NVDA CEO Jensen Huang has also projected the widespread deployment of humanoid robots in manufacturing units in the next five years.
Previously, it was reported that Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN has committed up to $25 billion to improve its retail network, including developing robotics-driven warehouses to enhance efficiency.
This investment was aimed at staying ahead of competitors, particularly Temu, which is owned by China's PDD Holdings PDD. 
However, Alibaba Group BABA chairman Joe Tsai appears to have a skeptical outlook. On Wednesday, during an event, he questioned the practicality of humanoid robots.
Price Action: Tesla’s stock fell 5.58% during Wednesday’s regular trading session, closing at $272.06. In after-hours trading, it declined further by 1.34% to $268.41. Year-to-date, Tesla shares have dropped 28.27%, according to Benzinga Pro data.

TSLA,'Dominant': US and Chinese robotics start-ups attract 75% of global funding,20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.220403,"America and China are 'reinforcing their leadership' in robotics, allowing them to shape the future of automation, new study finds.",South China Morning Post,www.scmp.com,https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3304070/us-and-chinese-robotics-start-ups-attract-75-global-funding-study-finds,"America and China are ‘reinforcing their leadership’ in robotics, allowing them to shape the future of automation, new study finds
China and the United States accounted for 75 per cent of all venture capital investment in the robotics space over the past six years, allowing them to build a formidable lead in a crucial emerging industry, according to a study by the analytics firm GlobalData.
The scale of investment into US and Chinese robotics start-ups between 2018 and 2024 shows the two powers are “emerging as dominant forces” and “reinforcing their leadership in driving innovation, attracting investor interest, and shaping the future of automation and intelligent systems”, the London-based company said in a statement.
A total of US$100.9 billion of venture capital was invested in robotics between 2018 and 2024, with the US accounting for US$49.9 billion of those deals and China attracting investments worth US$24.4 billion, GlobalData found.
Despite a dip during the pandemic, nearly 6,000 venture capital deals were announced in robotics worldwide over the same period. Just over 2,000 involved start-ups in the US, while 1,532 involved firms in China.
China, where the bulk of venture capital comes from state-backed funds, has poured resources into robotics over the past decade with the aim of upgrading its vast manufacturing sector."

Musk highlighted on X that while Tesla manufactures all its U.S.-sold vehicles domestically, it still imports parts from other countries, particularly from China.
Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant.
What Happened: Following the tariff announcement, Tesla’s shares plummeted nearly 6% on Wednesday. The tariffs are expected to further complicate Tesla’s efforts to refresh its aging electric vehicle lineup, advance autonomous driving technology, and develop robotaxis.
Musk, in his post on X, said that the cost impact of the tariffs on Tesla is ""not trivial.""
To be clear, this will affect the price of parts in Tesla cars that come from other countries. The cost impact is not trivial.
Additionally, Tesla is dealing with a consumer boycott in both Europe and the U.S. due to Musk’s alleged connections to the far-right and his involvement with the Trump administration.

Recent data revealed a significant drop in Tesla’s European sales, which fell over 40% for the second consecutive month in February, amid increasing competition and declining demand.
Why It Matters: The introduction of a 25% tariff on auto imports by President Trump is intended to bolster domestic production, potentially generating $100 billion annually.
However, this move has sparked criticism from international partners like Canada and the EU, who have opposed the tariffs.
Economists and market analysts have expressed concerns about the potential economic repercussions of these tariffs. The increased costs could lead to higher car prices and potentially impact interest rates.
This could further strain automakers like Tesla, which rely on global supply chains for essential components.
Amidst these developments, President Trump’s approval rating has reached a new low since his re-election, reflecting public dissatisfaction with his economic policies.

What Happened: Speaking at Alibaba's Jumpstarter event in Hong Kong on Wednesday, Tsai expressed doubt about the push to develop humanoid robots, asking, ""What is the application of a humanoid?""
""I want machines to do things I don't want to do, but I don't need machines to replace humans in doing things that I want to do,"" he said, reported the South China Morning Post, which is also owned by Alibaba.

While acknowledging AI's growing utility, Tsai said much of what humans value—such as emotional intelligence and compassion—is not captured in machine learning data. 
""All the positive encounters that you have with people that you love… how does the machine capture that data to replicate the positive energy?"" he asked.
Why It's Important: During his keynote speech at Nvidia's annual developer conference in San Jose, California, Huang said it may be ""when, literally, humanoid robots are wandering around, which is not five years away. This is not five-years-away problem; this is a few-years-away problem.""

Huang believes that humanoid robots will see their earliest widespread adoption in the manufacturing sector. He explained that factory work involves well-defined tasks carried out in a controlled setting, making it easier to automate.
Previously, Elon Musk also said that Tesla, Inc. TSLA plans to produce several thousand Optimus robots this year, assigning them to handle unpopular tasks at the company’s factory by year-end.
Meanwhile, Jim Cramer has warned against reducing AI computational capabilities, following Tsai’s earlier comments on a potential data center bubble.
Speaking at the HSBC Global Investment Summit in Hong Kong, Tsai cautioned that tech companies and investment funds are pouring billions into infrastructure without a well-defined customer base.
Alibaba is also actively integrating AI into various sectors, including a partnership with Bayerische Motoren Werke AG BMWKY to develop AI-powered smart assistants for next-generation vehicles.
Price Action: Alibaba’s stock edged up 0.033% in after-hours trading to $132.28 after closing at $132.24 on Wednesday, reflecting a 0.38% drop during regular trading. Despite this, the stock has gained 55.67% year-to-date, according to Benzinga Pro data.

From broadband internet and mobile phones to cash-free societies, digital government and cloud computing, Nordic countries’ early adoption of innovations has often given their companies a head start. 
The quick response that helped Nokia, Skype, Spotify and Klarna dominate their industries is now benefiting Nordic companies in emerging fields such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and cloud software.
“Once you are an early starter in this industry . . . you have an advantage,” says Benny Guttman, senior partner at the consultancy Roland Berger, of the EV charging market.
Norway has been the global leader in the transition to EVs since 2013, when the Tesla Model S was the best-selling car, surpassing petrol rivals. Last year, 89 per cent of new car sales in Norway were pure electric, while in Denmark the figure was 52 per cent. In Sweden, 32 per cent of sales were electric, and 58 per cent with plug-in hybrids, while in Finland the figures were 29 per cent and 69 per cent.

Kempower, a Finnish charging hardware company which is eighth in the FT1000 ranking of Europe’s Fastest Growing Companies, and Virta (ranked 283rd), a Finnish company which focuses on charging software and payment solutions, have both benefited from the early rollout of EV charging networks in the region.
“Nordic countries have been [among] the most advanced players in incentivising this transition and this has brought the technologies forward, and then the market,” says Jussi Palola, chief innovation officer and co-founder at Virta.
He also credits the Finnish government for launching a €110mn project to fund research on EV charging systems in 2011, which led to the creation of Virta and Kempower. “The logic from the Finnish perspective was that this transition is essential, it is going to happen, and we want to lead the technologies in this area,” Palola says.
Company purchases of electric vehicles for employees, encouraged by tax incentives, helped spur the development of the market in Sweden, with the EV share of company purchases growing from 16 per cent in 2018 to 74 per cent in 2023.
The high-profile collapse of Swedish battery maker Northvolt sent shockwaves through the renewables sector. But Guttman dismisses fears of a backlash after recent US policy shifts.
Nordic companies have shown a similar openness to innovation when adopting software solutions to make processes such as hiring, accounting, marketing and sales more efficient.
This openness comes down to the level of trust, transparency and positive experience with digitisation in each of the Nordic countries
“The level of digitisation and the openness towards digitisation is just next level,” says Milos Lørup Bartosek, an Oslo-based director at the consultancy Strategy&, part of PwC. “This openness comes down to the level of trust, transparency and positive experience with digitisation in each of the Nordic countries, which is much higher than we observe . . . in the UK and Germany.”
This openness has helped power the rapid growth of companies such as Sweden’s Teamtailor and Funnel, Norway’s Omnium, and Finland’s Epassi, which help companies with recruitment, sales, order management and employee benefits respectively. Of the 42 Nordic companies in the ranking, 12 offer some kind of cloud-based subscription software service to other businesses.
“They’re not necessarily the next Microsoft, but they find very strong niches in which you can build businesses with revenues in the hundreds of millions of euros”, Bartosek says of the business-to-business software-as-a-service or “B2B SaaS” sector.
The key, as outlined in a Strategy& Nordic sector report, has been providing “an incredibly strong value proposition” to customers, especially in the small and medium sized business segment. This helps them to carry out key functions better with fewer staff, so that savings and improved performance more than cover the cost of subscription.
Trust also fosters co-operation between Nordic companies. Virta has made KemPower a preferred hardware partner and the SaaS companies offer integrations with dozens of other similar businesses, both Nordic and international.
“Nordic companies tend to collaborate,” Guttman says, noting that “there are clear benefits to being Nordic in another Nordic country”.
As well as a receptive regional customer base, the region also has hubs and incubators for start-ups, seed capital from government agencies and angel investors, and growth capital from investors such as Sweden’s Creandum, Norway’s Verdane, and Denmark’s ByFounders.

Most of these companies have continued to grow despite a slowdown in Nordic economies in recent years. GDP in Finland and Sweden shrank by 1.2 and 0.3 per cent respectively in 2023, while that of Norway, excluding oil and gas, grew by 0.5 per cent. While there were signs of recovery in 2024, growth remains weak, with Sweden’s and mainland Norway’s economies growing by 1 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively, while Finland’s shrank by 0.5 per cent. 
Denmark’s economy has been the exception, with GDP growth of 2.5 per cent in 2023 and 3.2 per cent in 2024, thanks partly to the success of Novo Nordisk’s obesity drug Wegovy.
The B2B SaaS companies have been resilient primarily because most offer ways for their customers to cut costs. The shift to EVs, meanwhile, is continuing, despite the economic slowdown and the removal of subsidies.
“Of course, the global economic turmoil has slowed down some markets,” says Palola. But he predicts revenue growth this year, with Europe’s EV fleet to increase by 20 to 25 per cent.
A bigger threat is competition. Advanced AI companies now threaten B2B SaaS by fully automating tasks such businesses had only helped clients to do more efficiently.
“The big question for every B2B SaaS company is how it will be able to integrate itself into the AI ecosystem, and how to develop its own agents using AI,” Bartosek says.
Vehicle-charging companies, meanwhile, face competition from lower cost Chinese rivals and larger European and US companies.
“It’s going to be a little bit tougher going forward for these companies, especially those that don’t have positive cash flows,” Guttman says. “Some will go out of business, some will be bought up, and some will thrive.”"

President Donald Trump‘s announcement of a 25% tariff on auto imports has sparked widespread concern among economists and market analysts, with many warning of potential severe economic consequences.
What Happened: The tariffs, set to take effect on Apr. 3, aim to boost domestic auto manufacturing but could trigger significant market disruption. Prominent economists have raised alarms about the potential economic fallout. Peter Schiff highlighted that the tariffs will increase car prices and potentially put upward pressure on interest rates.
Trump imposed 25% tariffs on imported cars, which will raise the price of all cars. Then he's also proposing the tax deductibility of interest on loans to buy domestic cars. Since cars will cost more, the size of auto loans will rise, putting upward pressure on interest rates.
Economist Justin Wolfers suggested the tariffs might discourage car purchases, potentially creating a ripple effect across the automotive market. 
We've been thinking about buying a second car, but with tariffs boosting the cost of imports by 25% — and reduced competition boosting prices of domestics — I might just wait a bit, hoping he walks it back.Now work through the macro consequences if others have similar thoughts.
Gary Black of The Future Fund LLC was even more direct, stating that Trump has “found further ways to push the economy into recession.”
Trump (aka Tariff man) found further ways to push the economy into recession today, signing a proclamation to implement a 25% tariff on auto imports, expanding a trade war designed to bring more manufacturing jobs to the US and setting the stage for an even broader push on levies…
Providing historical context, Scott Paul, President of The Alliance for American Manufacturing, noted that ‘Trump would not be 1st POTUS to suggest higher tariffs on autos,’ citing long-standing tariffs on pickup trucks and recent tariffs on Chinese EVs. 
Trump would not be 1st POTUS to suggest higher tariffs on autos. We've had 25% tariffs on pickup trucks (- Canada & Mexico) for 40+ years. Biden imposed 100% tariffs on Chinese EVs to prevent them. US absorbs more car imports than any other nation by far…via @dunne_insights pic.twitter.com/qQGdNdXDyH
The United Auto Workers, meanwhile, advocated for auto companies to absorb the tariff costs, stating, ‘auto companies…should absorb the cost of these tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers,’ suggesting potential legislative support.
As they shift their supply chains and investments to the US, auto companies that have enjoyed years of record profits should absorb the cost of these tariffs rather than passing them on to consumers, and the UAW would support legislative or regulatory action requiring them to do…

Why It Matters: The market’s immediate reaction was negative, with the S&P 500, tracked by SPDR S&P 500 SPY, dropping 1.1% and the Nasdaq 100, tracked by Invesco QQQ Trust, Series 1 QQQ, falling 1.83%. Automotive stocks saw significant declines, with Tesla Inc. TSLA dropping 5.6% and General Motors Co. GM falling 9.11%.
The tariffs will primarily affect non-U.S. content in autos under the USMCA trade pact. The Trump administration argues that U.S. automakers have sufficient capacity to increase domestic production and avoid tariffs.
Some potential beneficiaries include companies with strong domestic production, like Tesla, Toyota Motor Corp. TM, BYD BYDDY, and domestic used car dealers such as AutoNation Inc. AN and CarMax Inc. KMX.

This decision aims to stimulate domestic production but could financially strain automakers dependent on international supply chains.,Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/25/03/44506345/trump-imposes-25-tariffs-on-auto-imports-says-this-will-continue-to-spur-growth-canada-eu-slam-the-move,"President Donald Trump declared on Wednesday the introduction of a 25% tariff on auto imports. This decision aims to stimulate domestic production but could financially strain automakers dependent on international supply chains.
What Happened: The tariffs, poised to generate $100 billion annually, are set to be enforced starting April 3, reported the Associated Press. The administration anticipates that the increased costs will incentivize the opening of more factories within the U.S., thereby reducing dependence on global supply chains. However, American automakers, who rely on components sourced globally, might face heightened expenses and reduced sales.
“This will continue to spur growth,” said Trump on his decision, according to the Press.
Under the USMCA trade pact covering the United States, Mexico, and Canada, the 25% tariffs would only affect non-U.S. content in autos and parts.
The administration argues that U.S. automakers have enough excess capacity to increase domestic production and bypass the tariffs. An official also pointed out that automakers have been aware of the potential tariffs since Trump’s campaign.
Shares of General Motors Co. GM dropped by over 3% on Wednesday, while Ford Motor Co. F experienced a slight uptick. Stellantis N.V. STLA, the parent company of Jeep and Chrysler, saw its stock value decline by nearly 3.6%.
International leaders, including Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, have criticized the tariffs, suggesting a potential escalation into a global trade conflict. Trump also proposed a tax incentive for American-made vehicles, allowing buyers to deduct auto loan interest from federal taxes.
Carney said, “This is a very direct attack.” The Prime Minister vowed to defend Canadian workers and companies. He said, “We will defend our country.”

Why It Matters: The announcement follows Trump’s earlier hints that the tariffs might be less stringent than initially anticipated, offering some relief to investors. During a Newsmax interview, Trump suggested a more lenient approach, acknowledging minimal exceptions.
Earlier, Trump had indicated that while tariffs on automobiles were imminent, not all would be enforced by April 2. He mentioned potential exemptions for certain countries, though specifics were not provided.
Trump’s tariffs on steel, aluminum, and auto imports hurt foreign-part-dependent automakers but benefit companies with strong domestic production and supply chains. Tesla Inc. TSLA, Toyota Motor Corp. TM,  BYD Company Limited BYDDY, and GM are poised to gain, while automakers reliant on cross-border supply chains face higher costs. Used car dealers like AutoNation, Inc. AN and CarMax, Inc. KMX may also benefit as new car prices rise.

Key Points
After a bit of a rebound, the Nasdaq Composite index is no longer officially in correction territory, for now at least, down by just 9% from the recent highs as of this writing. However, when it comes to finding excellent ETFs, there are still some excellent bargains for long-term investors.
With that in mind, here are two ETFs, one passive index fund and one actively managed fund, that concentrate on technology stocks and are still down by more than 10%.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT -1.04%) is an index fund offered by low-cost fund provider Vanguard, and with a 0.09% expense ratio, it's one of the cheapest ways to get broad technology exposure. Even after the market's recent rebound, it's still more than 11% below its 2025 peak.
In a nutshell, this is a fund that tracks the overall information technology sector, more commonly referred to as simply ""the tech sector."" It's a weighted index of about 315 stocks, and as you might expect, it's heavily weighted toward some of the Magnificent Seven stocks. In fact, the fund's top three holdings -- Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- make up 46% of the assets.
Interestingly, some of the largest tech companies, such as Amazon.com, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Tesla are notably absent, as they aren't technically included in the information technology sector. But this ETF can be an excellent way to get exposure to some of the hottest technology trends, and for a significantly lower price than you would have paid earlier this year.
The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -0.97%) is the largest ETF offered by notable tech investor Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. After the recent market volatility, it still trades for about 21% below its February peak, even after a bit of a rebound.
This is an actively managed ETF, not an index fund, which means that portfolio managers (in this case, Cathie Wood) select stocks with the goal of beating a certain benchmark index. And this is a portfolio of about 36 excellent technology stocks, many of which have been beaten down in this year's market turbulence despite being great businesses with tremendous potential. 
Just to name a few, the fund's top five holdings are Tesla, Roku, Roblox, Coinbase, and Palantir. You'll also find several other major tech stocks, as well as some small caps that Wood and her team feel have a lot of potential.
The Ark Innovation ETF has a 0.75% expense ratio, which is higher than you'd expect from the typical index fund but is on par with what other actively managed funds charge.
In full disclosure, I already own a different Cathie Wood ETF in my portfolio, the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -1.17%). I bought that one specifically for AI exposure. But the Ark Innovation ETF seems like an attractive way to get exposure to some of the highest-potential technology stocks at a discount, and it's on my watch list right now.
Although I think these both look appealing right now, it's important to emphasize that I'm saying that from a long-term perspective. I have no idea what the market, or these two funds, will do over the coming weeks or months, and if we get more market volatility, it's entirely possible they could fall further. However, if you measure your investment returns in periods of multiple years, now could be a great time to take a closer look.

Key Points
This billionaire mutual fund manager thinks Tesla could become a $5 trillion business.
Ron Baron is a billionaire mutual fund investor and the founder of wealth management firm Baron Capital. Back in November, Baron sat down for an interview with CNBC's morning program, Squawk Box, and proclaimed that he sees Tesla (TSLA 1.84%) reaching a $5 trillion valuation within the next decade.
Well, earlier this month Baron joined Squawk Box again and he appears to be doubling down on his high conviction in Tesla.
As of market close on March 21, Tesla sported a market capitalization of $800 billion. Can Tesla's valuation really rise more than 500% over the next 10 years as Baron suggests?
Let's find out what's behind Baron's bull thesis and assess if Tesla can realistically become a $5 trillion business.
Believe it or not, artificial intelligence (AI) has a lot of use cases in the car industry. One of the more notable ambitions that car manufacturers are increasingly exploring is autonomous driving -- or the ability for a vehicle to drive itself without human intervention.
Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been vocal about his ambitions to integrate self-driving software into the company's vehicles for years. Right now, Tesla owners can choose to subscribe to the company's autonomous driving software -- dubbed Full Self-Driving (FSD) -- in certain geographic regions.
However, the more lucrative opportunity for Tesla revolves around the company's robotaxi initiative.
Essentially, the robotaxi program is planned to be a widespread fleet of Tesla vehicles on the road that consumers can use. In the section below, I'll break down why robotaxis could be the tailwind that propels Tesla's valuation well into the trillions.
Image source: Tesla.
The video below is from Baron's recent segment on CNBC. When you first listen to his assumptions, it almost seems too good to be true. After all, why is the robotaxi business expected to carry such high profit margins?
Ron Baron about Tesla $tsla: ""If you do 50,000 miles a year for a car (Robotaxi) those cars generate ... 30, or 40 or 50,000 Dollars in profits per year. Per car. So every time you have a million cars you adding 30, or 40 or 50 Billion Dollar to profits per year."" pic.twitter.com/5sTbakQKsi



The idea here is that FSD is a software product that's available for a subscription. Subscription services tend to boast high gross margins given the their recurring revenue streams.
If we expand upon FSD and imagine a scenario in which Tesla has fleets of robotaxis around the world, the underlying theory is that people may choose to use one of these vehicles to hail a ride or even rent them while traveling.
In essence, Tesla is trying to parlay the recurring nature of an FSD subscription to a commercially available fleet of its cars that are conveniently available for a multitude of services. If the company pulls this off, robotaxis could become an enormously sticky business for Tesla and unlock billions of new cash flow for the business -- hence, investors could begin to assign Tesla a premium valuation multiple that's more commonly seen in high-growth software businesses.
When I was younger, I spent several years working as a financial analyst at an investment bank. I bring this up because I've built and tweaked a lot of financial models, budgets, and forecasts in my time.
One thing that I can say about financial modeling is that it is a highly sensitive exercise. Forecasts can change drastically depending on the set of assumptions you're using.
While I fully comprehend the potential of the robotaxi initiative, I'm also asking myself the following questions:
I bring these points up because it's very easy for investors to become enamored by the potential of an exciting idea. But to me, the answers to the questions outlined above aren't entirely clear right now.
How can you integrate those parameters into a forecast? The real answer is that you can't really do that without making even more assumptions, thereby making a future price prediction even more susceptible to different variables and outcomes.
At the end of the day, I do think the robotaxi initiative will become a highly successful endeavor for Tesla. But for now, I wouldn't invest in Tesla stock expecting its value to rise sixfold over the next several years.
Instead, I think if you are a growth-oriented investor who can stomach volatility and wants exposure to the AI industry, then buying the current dip in Tesla stock with the idea of holding your shares for many years could be a reasonable choice right now.

TSLA,"4 EV Stocks Soaring As Tesla Tumbles - BYD  ( OTC:BYDDY ) , Honda Motor Co  ( NYSE:HMC ) ",20250326,Somewhat-bullish,0.191871,"NBA legend Michael Jordan once famously said, ""Republicans buy sneakers too,"" emphasizing his choice to steer clear of politics while his iconic shoes propelled Nike to the pinnacle of sports retail. That's advice Tesla TSLA shareholders may wish the company's CEO, Elon Musk, had taken to heart.",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/25/03/44504665/4-ev-stocks-soaring-as-tesla-tumbles,"NBA legend Michael Jordan once famously said, ""Republicans buy sneakers too,"" emphasizing his choice to steer clear of politics while his iconic shoes propelled Nike to the pinnacle of sports retail.
That’s advice Tesla TSLA shareholders may wish the company’s CEO, Elon Musk, had taken to heart. Shares are down more than 32% this year, as Musk’s heavy involvement with the new administration has cratered Tesla’s electric vehicle (EV) sales.
Tesla sales are down 40% in Europe compared to last year, even as total EV sales soared by 26%. The picture is only slightly rosier in the U.S., with Tesla sales down 11% in January. In China, the world’s largest market for electric vehicles, Tesla has been overtaken by a domestic rival for the first time.
But all this bad news for Tesla has been great news for other EV makers. 
Here are four non-Tesla EV stocks set to profit from soaring EV sales.
News of BYD Company's BYDDY battery breakthrough earlier this month sent the stock to new all-time highs. BYD's new Super-E platform promises to provide a range of 249 miles with a simple five-minute charge, easing a major customer concern. However, investors with keen eyes have had BYD on their radar for a while, as the stock has risen 88% in the last 12 months (including a 43% rip over the previous three). As mentioned above, the company is now outselling Tesla in China, and the government has been providing very accommodating policies.  
BYD is a conglomerate with several divisions. BYD Auto is the most well-known, thanks to its electric and hybrid vehicles and battery charging solutions. Still, the company also has BYD Electronics and FinDream, which manufacture electronic parts, vehicle components and batteries. The automotive division brings in 80% of the company's revenue. The stock trades at 32 times earnings, far cheaper than TSLA, and the chart shows signs of the uptrend continuing. The share price is firmly above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates that the upside momentum remains intact.
The German automotive giant, Volkswagen Ag VWAGY is finally showing signs of breaking out of a multi-year downtrend. Tesla's losses in Europe have been Volkswagen's gains as registration numbers are skyrocketing for several of the firm's vehicles, including the newest top-selling European battery-powered EV: the Volkswagen ID.4. The Volkswagen ID.7 had the third most number of registrations to start the year, an upswing of more than 650%. On the plug-in hybrid side, the Volkswagen Tiguan is the second-highest-selling model in 2025, with an upstick of 250% over the previous period in 2024.
Volkswagen stock is down more than 25% in the last 12 months, but momentum is beginning to turn. Shares are up over 20% year-to-date, and the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), a momentum indicator, is starting to send bullish signals. VWAGY trades at just 4.8 times earnings and pays a healthy 8% dividend yield. And let's not forget the stimulus set to be unleashed in Germany, some of which will surely find its way to automakers like Volkswagen.
Toyota Motors TM is the world’s largest automaker, with a market cap above $251 billion and an annual revenue of about $309 billion. Toyota is choosing to focus on plug-in hybrids over full-battery electric cars, and the RAV4 SUV is a top choice for customers looking for a mix of electric and gas power.
Toyota controls more than 10% of the world's automobile market share, giving it a tremendous opportunity to eat into Tesla's EV sales. The company already has high margins, reporting a 20.32% gross margin rate and a 10.86% profit margin rate in the most recent quarter. The stock has a forward Price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 8.80 and a Price-to-sales (P/S) rate of 0.86, implying this $250 billion behemoth is undervalued. Additionally, the stock pays a 3.5% dividend yield and scored a 97.95 in Value and 98.51 in Quality on Benzinga Edge rankings, indicating both short- and medium-term upside. Another bullish signal was triggered recently as the stock price breached the 50-day moving average after nearly a year of trading below it.
Honda Motor HMC may not dominate the automobile market share like Toyota. Still, the Tokyo-based manufacturer is known for its highly reliable and safe vehicles, such as the popular Honda Accord and Civic sedan models. The company also has several hybrids and electric cars on its line, including the plug-in versions of the Accord, Civi, and CR-V, a fully electric Honda Prologue, and the fuel cell-powered CR-V e-FCEV.
HMC scores a 99.67 in Value and 98.67 in Quality on Benzinga Edge; it trades at just 6.6 times forward earnings and 0.32 times sales. And while a 4.8% profit margin is something Tesla would scoff at, it's still a fair number for an automobile manufacturer. The stock hit a multi-year bottom in December 2024 but has since recovered from under $23 to over $30 to start 2025. Like Toyota, this stock is hovering near its 50-day moving average, which had previously acted as a resistance level. Toyota broke through this resistance. Keep tracking Honda to see if its stock does the same.

""As we strive to be the leading energy and experience provider people rely on to fuel their journeys, our travel centers are uniquely able to fill a need for EV owners looking to make the most of their miles,"" Pilot VP of alternative fuels Shannon Sturgil said.

Why It's Important: The 2022 partnership called for building up to 2,000 fast-charging stalls at up to 500 Pilot and Flying J locations.
People traveling on vacation, to sporting events, to visit family, and for other reasons across the country now have more options for charging their EVs with convenient locations along the major highways.
The travel centers offer lounges, free Wi-Fi, restrooms, on-site restaurants, and other amenities not often found at other charging locations, including Tesla Superchargers.
The fast chargers allow consumers to charge their vehicles in as little as 15 minutes. With food options and Wi-Fi, short breaks to get vehicles charged are likely more convenient at Pilot and Flying J locations than at traditional charging stations.
Berkshire Hathaway owned 38.6% of Pilot Travel Centers, the parent company of Pilot and Flying J, when the deal was first announced in 2022. The company increased its stake to 80% in 2023 and owned 100% of the company as of January 2024.
Pilot Travel Centers is one of the largest travel centers in the country.

Tesla, Inc. TSLA stock is trading lower amid overall market weakness, possibly due to uncertainty around tariffs.
The Details: On Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that President Donald Trump and his administration may narrow upcoming tariffs to exclude certain industries.
The White House is expected to announce a range of reciprocal tariffs on April 2, a day sometimes referred to as “Liberation Day.” The administration is anticipated to exclude certain sectors, such as semiconductors and automobiles, from these tariffs, though it has not yet been announced which sectors will be exempt.
Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent explained that the administration is focusing on imposing tariffs on the “dirty 15.” The “dirty 15” is a name given to 15% of countries with a persistent trade imbalance with the U.S. The administration has not clarified what countries are a part of the “dirty 15,” but the secretary said the countries make up most of the U.S.’s foreign trade.
Market uncertainty may stem from the possibility that exemptions from the upcoming tariffs could significantly benefit any sector excluded from them by preventing rising costs. Tesla, an electric vehicle manufacturer, relies on international markets to produce its products, and an exemption for the electric vehicle sector would likely boost Tesla’s profits.
What Else: Canada’s Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland announced that the country has frozen all rebate payments to Tesla, totaling C$43 million ($30.08 million). Furthermore, she said she would make sure the company is excluded from future electric vehicle rebate programs.
The decision was made in response to U.S. tariffs, described by the minister as “illegitimate and illegal.”

Key Points
Shares of Tesla (TSLA 1.84%) are falling on Wednesday. The electric vehicle maker's stock lost 3.8% as of 3:30 p.m. ET and was down as much as 5.4% earlier in the day. The steep decline comes as the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes lost 0.6% and 1.3%, respectively.
The EV leader is facing new headwinds as international trade tensions escalate into direct action against the company.
Canada announced it has frozen $43 million in suspicious EV rebates for Tesla vehicles and will investigate each claim to verify their legitimacy. The announcement comes after the EV maker submitted thousands of claims in the days before the rebate program ended, the equivalent of selling two cars every minute, 24 hours a day. 
Canadian Transport Minister Chrystia Freeland has directed her ministry to explicitly exclude Tesla vehicles from the country's zero-emission rebate program for as long as ""illegitimate and illegal U.S. tariffs are imposed against Canada.""
The targeted move is one of the first and clearest direct regulatory actions against Tesla resulting from President Trump's recent tariff policies and Tesla CEO Elon Musk's prominent position in his administration. This is likely to significantly affect the company's ability to sell vehicles in Canada.
This is one more in a series of recent woes for the company that stem in large part from Musk's actions. The company has seen its sales plummet across key markets from China to the E.U. as Musk inserts himself into the politics of countries around the world. This comes at an already vulnerable time for Tesla as it faces stiffening competition from legacy manufacturers and Chinese EV rivals. Even after the significant drop in price over the past few months, I think Tesla remains overpriced, and I would avoid the stock.

In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
The SPY is currently trading near our pivotal mark of 574.65. Buyers must initially push prices above 575.67 to demonstrate momentum. If buying persists above this area, expect bulls to challenge the next critical zone at 576.62. Maintaining strength at 576.62 through the trading session could propel SPY upward, targeting resistance at 577.87. Our top bullish goal today for SPY is set at 579.12.
Should 574.65 fail as support, sellers will aim lower, challenging 573.50 to test bullish commitment. A breach here would likely accelerate bearish action, driving price toward 572.15. Persistent selling momentum beneath this level would next target the critical support at 571.06. On a particularly aggressive selling day, SPY could reach our ultimate bearish objective of 569.98.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
The QQQ is presently hovering around our essential price of 493.60. Bulls need to maintain and stabilize price action here, pushing higher to reclaim 495.35 decisively. If successful, bullish traders could drive prices upward to challenge 496.94 next. With sustained buying strength, further gains toward 498.37 become likely, putting our peak bullish target for today at 499.44 within reach.
If bulls fail to defend 493.60 intraday, expect bearish pressure to quickly drive prices toward the downside level at 491.82. Continued weakness could extend declines to 490.05, with further aggressive selling potentially targeting support at 487.69. A failure to stabilize here could cause prices to tumble further toward our low bearish target today at 486.10.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is currently trading close to our crucial pivot at 223.87. Buyers must secure this as reliable support, creating momentum toward the next upside target at 225.31. Should bullish participants continue to dominate price action, Apple shares could advance further to test 226.08. If momentum remains robust throughout the session, expect Apple to challenge our primary bullish target today at 226.90.
If price action fails to maintain 223.87 intraday, selling pressure will likely push Apple lower, initially targeting 222.96. Continued weakness would encourage bearish traders to seek further downside toward 222.24. If selling pressure persists below this area, expect Apple to test support at 221.66, potentially falling further toward today’s lower bearish target at 220.97.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft is currently navigating around our key intraday level of 394.46. Bullish momentum must emerge above this level, lifting the price to test the next significant zone at 395.68, which bulls must maintain decisively as support. Achieving stability here could generate a continued upward move to challenge 397.65. With sustained bullish engagement, Microsoft could reach today’s bullish target of 398.38.
If Microsoft falters at 394.46, sellers will likely apply pressure, testing support at 393.47. A clear breakdown below this area would indicate weakening momentum, targeting lower levels at 392.49. If bears gain stronger momentum, price action might extend declines toward 390.98, with our bottom bearish objective today established at 389.29.
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
NVIDIA currently trades around our crucial mark of 119.44. Bulls must rapidly advance the price to test and reclaim support at 120.27. Successful bullish action here could fuel a drive higher, targeting 121.97 next. Continued strong buying throughout today’s session could carry NVIDIA toward further resistance at 123.41, ultimately approaching our high bullish goal today of 125.21.
Should NVIDIA fail to maintain stability at 119.44, bears will press the price downward, initially targeting 117.86. Continued selling below this level could further weaken the market, leading NVIDIA toward support at 116.61. Persistent downside action may extend toward 115.83, with an aggressive bearish scenario placing today’s lowest target at 115.15.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is currently trading around our crucial pivot of 169.34. Bulls need to firmly hold this level to build upward momentum toward 171.14. Sustained bullish activity here could propel Alphabet’s price toward our primary bullish target for the session at 172.28.
A failure at 169.34 during today's trading would trigger bearish momentum, driving Alphabet initially toward 167.04. Increased selling could lead to further downside action toward 165.41. Persistent bearish strength could ultimately push Alphabet toward our lowest bearish target today at 163.79.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is presently positioned around our important intraday level of 629.88. Buyers need to establish firm support here, launching price action toward 635.49. Sustained buying activity could further elevate Meta shares toward 642.59. Continued bullish conviction today would enable traders to push prices toward our ultimate bullish target at 646.48.
Should Meta fail to secure 629.88 as intraday support, sellers will target the lower support at 622.01. Continued bearish activity could further pressure price toward 615.65. In the event of sustained selling intensity, bears may ultimately drive prices down to today’s bearish target at 609.30.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is currently trading around our significant pivot level of 283.95. Bulls should actively push price above this zone to initially challenge 286.34. With ongoing bullish activity, price momentum could reach higher resistance at 288.80. If overall market strength remains supportive, Tesla may extend its rally toward 290.47. Exceptional bullish interest could propel prices to our upper bullish objective for Tesla today at 293.21.
If bulls are unable to secure 283.95 as firm support, anticipate bearish traders driving Tesla toward lower levels starting at 281.32. Continued bearish pressure would likely encourage further selling toward 279.43. A clear breakdown below this support could result in aggressive selling, ultimately targeting our lowest bearish objective for Tesla today at 278.11.
Final Word:
Today's economic calendar is relatively sparse but still noteworthy. At 8:30 AM ET, markets receive the Preliminary Durable Goods Orders and Preliminary Capital Goods Orders data for February, providing insight into the underlying health of the manufacturing and industrial sectors. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury will conduct auctions at 11:30 AM ET for the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes, followed by the 5-Year FRN auction at 1 PM ET. Traders should also pay attention to scheduled Federal Reserve commentary, starting with non-voter Kashkari at 10 AM ET, and more significantly, voting member Musalem at 1:10 PM ET, whose remarks could influence market perceptions on the Fed's future policy stance.
Given these events, traders should anticipate volatility during auction windows and Federal Reserve commentary, adjusting risk accordingly. Manage positions carefully, remain disciplined, and ensure proper risk protocols are followed. Good luck trading today!

Key Points
The stock market has been rather turbulent in 2025, and although the S&P 500 is no longer in correction territory, there are still some excellent investment opportunities to be found.
In fact, there are some ETFs that look highly attractive for long-term investors right now. Here are three in particular I've bought for my own portfolio recently, and that I plan to continue buying for the foreseeable future.
The Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -1.17%) is down by about 17% from its 52-week high and looks like an interesting long-term opportunity. I added it to my portfolio recently, as I had been looking to increase my AI exposure, but there were two problems.
First, AI stocks really aren't my area of expertise. I'm a value investor at heart, and my core competencies are things like banks and real estate. Second, most other AI ETFs looked almost identical and focused on the massive technology stocks.
On the other hand, this is an actively managed ETF, overseen by tech investor Cathie Wood, that owns about three dozen stocks, with some smaller and outside-the-box AI plays among its largest holdings. The largest position, Tesla, is certainly a household name, but other top stocks, including Kratos Defense & Security, Teradyne, and Archer Aviation, are not. In short, this ETF focuses on high-potential names that could be big winners of the AI boom, not just the same megacap tech stocks you'll find in other tech ETFs.
At the beginning of 2025, small cap stocks, as defined by the Russell 2000 benchmark index, were trading at their lowest price-to-book valuation relative to their large-cap counterparts in more than 25 years. And with the S&P 500 outperforming the Russell 2000 so far in 2025, the gap has widened even further.
In a nutshell, I believe the gap will narrow considerably, and that's especially true if we get a falling-rate environment over the next few years, as experts predict. Lower interest rates can disproportionately favor small-cap stocks for a few reasons. For one thing, small caps tend to rely on borrowed money more than large caps do, and lower interest rates obviously help in this area. Plus, as rates fall, money starts flowing out of ""guaranteed"" return assets such as CDs and Treasuries, which can be a big lift for smaller, more speculative companies.
For these and a few other reasons, the Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF (VTWO -0.43%) is my No. 1 ETF pick to buy in 2025, and in full disclosure, it's the one on this list I've put the most of my own money into.
I added the Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF (VYMI 0.19%) to my portfolio in 2024, and it has been one of the better-performing investments I own, up about 10% so far in 2025.
However, even with shares near a 52-week high, this 4.4%-yielding ETF could still be worth a closer look, especially if you're looking for international diversification in your portfolio.
As the name suggests, this ETF tracks an index of international stocks with above-average dividend yields. There are just under 1,500 stocks in the index, which is weighted, so larger companies make up a larger percentage of the fund. Although it's an international index fund, that simply means that its components are based outside of the United States. Many have large U.S. operations are household names to American investors, such as Nestle, Toyota, and Shell, all of which are among the top 10 holdings.
The fund has a low 0.17% expense ratio, and even though it has performed well recently, it still looks rather cheap. For one thing, the average P/E ratio of its component stocks is about 12, and the average stock trades for 1.4 times book value. The U.S.-based Vanguard counterpart ETF, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (VYM -0.39%) has an average P/E and P/B of 19.8 and 2.9, respectively. 
To be clear, I have no idea what these three ETFs will do over the coming weeks or months. But from a long-term perspective, it looks like an attractive time to buy all three of these. I own all three in my portfolio already, and for very different reasons, and I plan to add more shares of each incrementally for as long as these valuations remain.
Matt Frankel has positions in Ark ETF Trust-Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF, Vanguard International High Dividend Yield ETF, and Vanguard Russell 2000 ETF. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Tesla and Vanguard Whitehall Funds-Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. The Motley Fool recommends Nestlé and Teradyne. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

NEW YORK, March  26, 2025  (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading securities law firm Bleichmar Fonti & Auld LLP announces that a lawsuit has been filed against Atkore Inc. ATKR and certain of the Company's senior executives for potential violations of the federal securities laws.
If you invested in Atkore, you are encouraged to obtain additional information by visiting https://www.bfalaw.com/cases-investigations/atkore-inc.
Investors have until April 23, 2025, to ask the Court to be appointed to lead the case. The complaint asserts claims under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 on behalf of investors who purchased Atkore stock. The case is pending in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois and is captioned Westchester Putnam Counties Heavy & Highway Laborers Local 60 Benefits Fund v. Atkore Inc., et al., No. 25-cv-01851.
Why was Atkore Sued for Securities Fraud?
Atkore manufactures electrical, safety, and infrastructure products including polyvinyl chloride water and electrical conduit pipes (""PVC Pipe""). During the COVID-19 pandemic, shipping costs rose dramatically, leaving foreign PVC Pipe manufacturers unable to profitably sell PVC Pipe in the U.S. As shipping prices returned to normal when the pandemic subsided in 2022, foreign PVC Pipe manufacturers gradually returned to the U.S. market. Shortly thereafter, in late 2022, the price of PVC Pipe began to decline.
As alleged, Atkore repeatedly misrepresented that post-pandemic PVC Pipe price declines were the result of ""pricing normalization"" that reflected ""competitive dynamics"" and assured investors that the Company would continue to successfully compete in the post-COVID-19 market.
On July 24, 2024, an activist investor named ManBear published a report titled ""Pipe Price Fixing"" which accused Atkore and three of its competitors of using the commodity pricing service OPIS to coordinate pricing actions and fix the price of PVC Pipe.
In truth, it is alleged that Atkore engaged in an anticompetitive price-fixing scheme that artificially inflated the price of PVC Pipes.
The Stock Declines as the Truth is Revealed
On February 4, 2025, Atkore announced disappointing earnings and reduced guidance, disclosing that the ""plastic pipe and conduit product category declined mid-single digits during the quarter"" compared to ""high single digits in the prior year,"" and largely attributed the guidance reduction to Atkore's PVC Pipe business, stating, ""roughly $75 million or 3/4 [of the guidance reduction] is on the PVC side."" This news caused the price of Atkore stock to decline nearly 20%, from $79.72 per share on February 3, 2025 to $64.13 per share on February 4, 2025.
On February 14, 2025, Atkore disclosed that it received a grand jury subpoena from the U.S. Department of Justice Antitrust Division seeking the ""production of documents relating to the pricing of the Company's PVC pipe and conduit products.""

TSLA CLOSES AT THE HIGH OF THE DAY AFTER CLIMBING ALMOST 11 POINTS 
Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) today experienced a Power Inflow, a significant event for those who follow where smart money goes and value order flow analytics in their trading decisions. 
Today, at 10:59 AM on March 25th, a significant trading signal occurred for Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) as it demonstrated a Power Inflow at a price of $277.42. This indicator is crucial for traders who want to know directionally where institutions and so-called ""smart money"" moves in the market. They see the value of utilizing order flow analytics to guide their trading decisions. The Power Inflow points to a possible uptrend in Tesla’s stock, marking a potential entry point for traders looking to capitalize on the expected upward movement. Traders with this signal closely watch for sustained momentum in Tesla’s stock price, interpreting this event as a bullish sign.
Signal description
Order flow analytics, aka transaction or market flow analysis, separate and study both the retail and institutional volume rate of orders (flow). It involves analyzing the flow of buy and sell orders, along with size, timing, and other associated characteristics and patterns, to gain insights and make more informed trading decisions. This particular indicator is interpreted as a bullish signal by active traders. 
The Power Inflow occurs within the first two hours of the market open and generally signals the trend that helps gauge the stock’s overall direction, powered by institutional activity in the stock, for the remainder of the day. 
By incorporating order flow analytics into their trading strategies, market participants can better interpret market conditions, identify trading opportunities, and potentially improve their trading performance. But let's not forget that while watching smart money flow can provide valuable insights, it is crucial to incorporate effective risk management strategies to protect capital and mitigate potential losses. Employing a consistent and effective risk management plan helps traders navigate the uncertainties of the market in a more controlled and calculated manner, increasing the likelihood of long-term success
