In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple AAPL against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.
Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.
Through a thorough examination of Apple, we can discern the following trends: 
At 35.16, the stock's Price to Earnings ratio significantly exceeds the industry average by 1.09x, suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers.
The elevated Price to Book ratio of 49.85 relative to the industry average by 9.64x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.
With a relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 8.57, which is 5.26x the industry average, the stock might be considered overvalued based on sales performance.
The Return on Equity (ROE) of 58.74% is 50.21% above the industry average, highlighting efficient use of equity to generate profits.
Compared to its industry, the company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $45.91 Billion, which is 117.72x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.
Compared to its industry, the company has higher gross profit of $58.27 Billion, which indicates 73.76x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.
The company's revenue growth of 3.95% is significantly below the industry average of 21.47%. This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is a measure that indicates the level of debt a company has taken on relative to the value of its assets net of liabilities.
Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
When comparing Apple with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed:
Among its top 4 peers, Apple is placed in the middle with a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45.
This implies a balanced financial structure, with a reasonable proportion of debt and equity.
For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency relative to its industry competitors.

Key Points
Investors aren't looking far enough down the road for its currently floundering AI efforts.
There's no denying it. Apple (AAPL 0.89%) was not only late to the artificial intelligence party, but it has struggled to catch up.
While the world was admittedly interested in Apple Intelligence's features unveiled in June of last year, demand for this tech -- as well as hardware that can handle it -- has been ho-hum. In fact, iPhone revenue fell during the quarter ending in December, while technology market research outfit IDC reports that unit sales of the iPhone slumped 4.1% year over year for the quarter in question. The company's AI-powered virtual assistant Siri has since been transferred to a new chief as well, after senior director Robby Walker called Apple's artificial intelligence results so far ""ugly and embarrassing.""
And yes, Apple shares have underperformed this year largely because of its disappointing artificial intelligence efforts.
Then again, perhaps the market was always expecting too much too soon. As UBS analyst David Vogt recently penned, investors shouldn't ""expect a significant improvement to Apple Intelligence over the next 12 months even with the upcoming [iPhone] 17 series in the fall of 2025,"" echoing timeline concerns voiced by Jefferies analyst Edison Lee and Wedbush's Dan Ives.
All three analysts, however, see AI-driven growth for Apple on the horizon once the company makes Apple Intelligence more marketable. In this vein, investment research house Imarc predicts the intelligent virtual assistant market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 26% through 2033. The market's likely to see this growth coming sooner rather than later, however, and simply sensing what awaits could be enough to (re)light a fire under this stock.
Analysts see it coming anyway. The analyst community's current 12-month consensus price target for Apple stands at $253.71 per share, up 15% from the stock's present price. Most of these analysts also rate Apple stock as at least a buy at this time.
The only missing ingredient is a catalyst convincing investors that Apple's AI efforts are back on track. The only problem? Once such a catalyst materializes, it may then be too late to step into a stake.

AAPL,How To Trade SPY With Initial Jobless Claims In Focus - NVIDIA  ( NASDAQ:NVDA ) ,20250327,Neutral,0.14591,"Good Morning Traders!

In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
Bulls currently have SPY trading near the critical pivot of 567.81. For a bullish scenario, a decisive move higher through 569.16 is crucial. Sustained buying above 569.98 could provide enough strength to target a rally towards 571.06. If buyers successfully defend this mark, expect continuation to the upside targeting 572.15, with an ambitious upside goal of 573.50. 
If SPY struggles and fails to maintain support at 567.81, bearish momentum would likely emerge, pushing prices down initially toward 566.46. Persistent selling pressure at this level could open the path to lower support zones at 565.38, followed by a critical test at 564.29. A heavy sell-off scenario today may extend prices down to our bearish objective at 563.23.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
QQQ is currently trading near the pivotal 481.73 level. For the bullish narrative to unfold, buyers must clearly establish dominance above this mark, followed by a firm move toward 483.95. Continued positive momentum should support an advance toward 486.10, potentially driving prices higher to test 487.69. If the bullish scenario plays out robustly, the day’s bullish target stands at 490.05. 
However, if buyers cannot maintain strength at 481.73, bears will likely seize control and press downward to test support at 479.03. Increasing bearish sentiment would likely prompt further selling toward 476.85, with subsequent downside continuation to a key support zone at 474.66. Should selling intensity increase, a drop towards our bearish goal at 471.33 becomes probable.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is trading near the key reference point of 220.29. For bullish traders, securing support above this mark is essential, potentially driving price action toward 220.97. Persistent upward momentum may fuel further bullish expansion toward 221.66, ultimately challenging the higher resistance area marked at our bullish target of 222.24. 
Conversely, failure to defend the level of 220.29 may activate bearish sentiment, prompting an initial sell-off toward 219.19. If bearish momentum accelerates, anticipate a deeper decline to support around 218.08, and further selling could extend the downside pressure to test 216.70. A sustained bearish environment may ultimately guide the price to our bearish objective at 215.25.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft's current price action revolves closely around our benchmark at 389.29. For bullish sentiment to remain intact, bulls must decisively defend this area and push upward toward the next resistance level of 390.98. Holding this level through regular trading hours could stimulate additional upward movement toward 392.49, and continued bullish activity may reach our primary bullish target of 393.47. 
If bulls fail to support price at 389.29, bearish traders could aggressively target initial downside at 388.53. Should this support fail, expect additional bearish momentum driving prices lower towards 387.60, and potentially extending further downward to 386.09. Under persistent selling pressure, the day’s bearish target for Microsoft is set at 385.42.
NVIDIA Corporation NVDA
NVIDIA is actively trading near our significant pivot at 111.70. Bullish participants will need to convincingly push through initial resistance at 112.54, firmly establishing support there to encourage upside continuation toward 113.68. Increased bullish strength may support a rally up to 114.29, with a bullish scenario setting sights on the primary bullish objective of 115.15. 
On the flip side, a breakdown below the key support level of 111.70 would open the possibility of bearish acceleration toward 110.73. A continuation of selling pressure could drive prices down further, testing 109.86. Additional weakness may prompt bears to push the auction even lower towards 109.12, with today’s bearish target resting at 107.51.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is trading closely near our significant pivot of 165.41. Bulls must defend this area effectively, enabling upward momentum toward initial resistance at 167.04. Continued bullish sentiment could propel prices further upwards, aiming at our primary bullish target today set at 169.34. 
Alternatively, a failure to hold support at 165.41 could initiate bearish activity pushing prices down towards the next key support level at 163.79. If bearish pressure remains intense, expect further decline toward 161.79. Sustained downside momentum could ultimately guide price toward our bearish objective today at 160.36.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is currently trading near the pivotal level of 604.50. Bulls will look to sustain support above this critical area, setting the stage for an initial bullish test at 609.30. Continued buying could further energize the auction towards 615.65, with a robust bullish environment potentially reaching our high bullish target today of 622.01. 
Should support at 604.50 fail during today’s session, bearish traders will likely drive prices downward toward the next key area at 598.17. If bearish sentiment intensifies, look for additional declines reaching 591.29. A deeper breakdown could eventually lead Meta's price action toward the bearish target today at 585.73.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is presently trading close to our essential reference point at 275.07. Bulls will aim for decisive upward momentum targeting initial resistance at 278.11. Sustained bullish sentiment could carry prices higher toward our next key level at 279.43, potentially advancing further toward 281.32. If buyer interest is particularly robust today, the ultimate bullish objective is established at 283.95. 
Conversely, should the 275.07 support level fail, anticipate immediate bearish pressure toward 272.42. Continued selling intensity could further pressure prices downwards, testing lower at 269.48. If bearish momentum deepens significantly, a further decline toward today's bearish target of 266.83 is likely.
Final Word:
Today’s trading environment is heavily influenced by key economic data, beginning with Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM ET, released concurrently with Advance Goods Trade Balance and Retail Inventories for February, along with the significant Q4 GDP Annualized Price Index (Third Reading). Later at 10 AM ET, Pending Home Sales data for February arrives, providing additional market-moving potential. Additionally, watch for the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity Index for March at 11:00 AM ET, followed by a crucial 7-Year Treasury Note Auction at 1 PM ET. 
Given the breadth and significance of today's economic releases, heightened volatility is anticipated across markets. Traders should approach today’s session prepared, emphasizing risk management and strategic patience, as data-driven price action could lead to considerable swings. Stay disciplined, and trade safe!

Microsoft stock went nowhere for over a decade, and Apple stock may do the same.
Apple (AAPL 0.89%) is a highly valued company that may take years to grow into its current valuation. We've seen this before with Microsoft (MSFT 0.04%), and it took more than a decade for the stock to make investors money. Travis Hoium highlights the comparison in this video.

AAPL,"After Siri Leadership Change, Apple Makes Another Major Executive Move in Retail: Report",20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.218482,"Apple Inc. AAPL is reportedly making a change to its leadership structure by promoting Vanessa Trigub, signaling long-term succession planning for senior vice president Deirdre O'Brien.",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/media/25/03/44509405/after-siri-leadership-change-apple-makes-another-major-executive-move-in-retail-report,"Apple Inc. AAPL is reportedly making a change to its leadership structure by promoting Vanessa Trigub, signaling long-term succession planning for senior vice president Deirdre O'Brien.
What Happened: Apple has decided to introduce a new position — vice president of stores and retail operations — and name Trigub to the role, according to a report by Bloomberg, citing people with knowledge of the matter.
Trigub, who has been with Apple since 2007 and currently oversees the retail operations in the Americas West region, will now manage global retail store operations and report directly to O'Brien.

While Apple has yet to confirm the leadership reshuffle publicly, sources familiar with the matter told the publication that Trigub is being groomed as a possible successor to O'Brien.
O'Brien has led Apple's retail and HR functions through several structural shifts since 2017.
Why It's Important: This marks the second significant leadership shift Apple has undergone in the past few weeks.
Previously, it was reported that Cupertino has finalized plans to transfer oversight of Siri from AI chief John Giannandrea to Mike Rockwell, the mastermind behind the Vision Pro.

Foxconn Technology Group, also known as Hon Hai Precision HNHPF, is poised to make significant strides in the electric vehicle market, announcing a strategic seminar in Japan on Apr. 9 to demonstrate its manufacturing capabilities and court potential automotive partnerships. 
What Happened: The Taiwan-based contract manufacturer, known for producing iPhones for Apple Inc. AAPL and AI servers for Nvidia Corp. NVDA, is leveraging its newly hired Chief EV Strategy Officer Jun Seki, a former Nissan executive, to showcase its automotive ambitions, Reuters reported, citing sources. 
The upcoming seminar represents a critical moment in Foxconn’s five-year EV manufacturing journey.
A landmark deal with Mitsubishi Motors marks a significant breakthrough for Foxconn’s automotive strategy. The contract involves manufacturing electric vehicles for sale in Oceania markets, including Australia, New Zealand, and Taiwan. 
Foxconn did not immediately respond to Benzinga's request for comment.

Why It Matters: This partnership comes at a crucial time when Japan’s automotive industry is facing increasing competition from agile Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD BYDDY.
The company’s EV joint venture, Foxtron, established with Taiwan’s Yulon, currently counts Luxgen as its primary client. Meanwhile, Foxconn is exploring broader strategic opportunities, including potential share acquisitions in established automotive companies like Nissan, contingent upon securing robust EV manufacturing partnerships.
Price Action: Hon Hai Precision is trading at 160.50 TWD ($4.85), down 3.31% on Thursday on the Taiwan Exchange as of 1.30 pm local time.

AAPL,Steve Jobs Warned 34 Years Ago About America Being 'Hollowed Out' By Foreign Manufacturing - A Concern Trump Now Echoes - Taiwan Semiconductor  ( NYSE:TSM ) ,20250327,Neutral,-0.031736,"More than three decades ago, Apple Inc. AAPL co-founder Steve Jobs sounded the alarm about America's growing reliance on foreign-made technology components-an issue that's back in the spotlight as President Donald Trump renews his criticism of U.S. dependence on overseas manufacturing.",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/tech/25/03/44506409/steve-jobs-warned-34-years-ago-about-america-being-hollowed-out-by-foreign-manufacturing-a-concern-trump-now,"Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.
More than three decades ago, Apple Inc. AAPL co-founder Steve Jobs sounded the alarm about America’s growing reliance on foreign-made technology components—an issue that's back in the spotlight as President Donald Trump renews his criticism of U.S. dependence on overseas manufacturing.
What Happened: In a 1991 interview, Jobs stated his concerns about the American tech industry losing control over critical hardware components, even as final assembly remained in the U.S.
 ""Even though most of the computers are assembled here in the United States, a significantly large number of the dollars… flows overseas,"" he said.
Jobs pointed to three of the most expensive parts in computers at the time—displays, dynamic memory (DRAM), and hard disk drives—all of which were predominantly manufactured outside the U.S.

""Almost all of those dollars flow to Japan,"" he said, particularly referencing display panels and memory chips. ""It's essential that we don't continue to be hollowed out as an industry,"" Jobs added.
At the time, the Apple co-founder also dismissed the idea that Wall Street was to blame for the lack of domestic investment in manufacturing infrastructure. ""Raising the capital is not the problem, and Wall Street is not the problem,"" he said. 
""The problem is that in many cases, the management of our companies is not from an engineering or manufacturing background anymore and may not appreciate the dependence we have on these underlying technologies.""
Jobs underscored the danger of U.S. tech companies outsourcing critical technologies and simply acting as ""final packagers"" of products. ""Ultimately, the providers of those components don't need the final packager. They can go directly to the consumer.""

Why It's Important: Trump has repeatedly vowed to restore American manufacturing and reduce reliance on Chinese supply chains, especially for semiconductors and critical tech.
Last month, Trump reportedly delivered a strong warning to pharmaceutical companies, urging them to relocate their manufacturing operations to the U.S. or risk being hit with tariffs.
On Wednesday, Trump announced a 25% tariff on auto imports to boost domestic production. While the administration argues that U.S. automakers can adapt, companies relying on global supply chains may face higher costs and reduced sales.
China's Huawei Technologies has now doubled AI chip yields following U.S. sanctions, and the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd's TSM expansion in America has made Taipei concerned.
Trump has previously criticized Taiwan for allegedly harming U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Reports also suggest Trump is considering scrapping the U.S. CHIPS and Science Act, which provides subsidies to boost domestic chip production and benefits companies like TSMC.
Apple has also doubled its U.S. advanced manufacturing fund from $5 billion to $10 billion to boost technology production in the country. The company is working with partners to build a new manufacturing facility in Houston, Texas, to produce servers that will power Apple Intelligence.
The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded for the second consecutive month in February 2025 but at a slower pace, with the Manufacturing PMI falling to 50.3% from 50.9% in January, missing market expectations.
Demand weakened as new orders and employment contracted, while production growth slowed sharply. Newly imposed tariffs drove costs higher, pushing prices up at the fastest rate since June 2022, highlighting concerns over rising inflationary pressures in the industry.

Key Points
After a bit of a rebound, the Nasdaq Composite index is no longer officially in correction territory, for now at least, down by just 9% from the recent highs as of this writing. However, when it comes to finding excellent ETFs, there are still some excellent bargains for long-term investors.
With that in mind, here are two ETFs, one passive index fund and one actively managed fund, that concentrate on technology stocks and are still down by more than 10%.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT -1.04%) is an index fund offered by low-cost fund provider Vanguard, and with a 0.09% expense ratio, it's one of the cheapest ways to get broad technology exposure. Even after the market's recent rebound, it's still more than 11% below its 2025 peak.
In a nutshell, this is a fund that tracks the overall information technology sector, more commonly referred to as simply ""the tech sector."" It's a weighted index of about 315 stocks, and as you might expect, it's heavily weighted toward some of the Magnificent Seven stocks. In fact, the fund's top three holdings -- Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- make up 46% of the assets.
Interestingly, some of the largest tech companies, such as Amazon.com, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Tesla are notably absent, as they aren't technically included in the information technology sector. But this ETF can be an excellent way to get exposure to some of the hottest technology trends, and for a significantly lower price than you would have paid earlier this year.
The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -0.97%) is the largest ETF offered by notable tech investor Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. After the recent market volatility, it still trades for about 21% below its February peak, even after a bit of a rebound.
This is an actively managed ETF, not an index fund, which means that portfolio managers (in this case, Cathie Wood) select stocks with the goal of beating a certain benchmark index. And this is a portfolio of about 36 excellent technology stocks, many of which have been beaten down in this year's market turbulence despite being great businesses with tremendous potential. 
Just to name a few, the fund's top five holdings are Tesla, Roku, Roblox, Coinbase, and Palantir. You'll also find several other major tech stocks, as well as some small caps that Wood and her team feel have a lot of potential.
The Ark Innovation ETF has a 0.75% expense ratio, which is higher than you'd expect from the typical index fund but is on par with what other actively managed funds charge.
In full disclosure, I already own a different Cathie Wood ETF in my portfolio, the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -1.17%). I bought that one specifically for AI exposure. But the Ark Innovation ETF seems like an attractive way to get exposure to some of the highest-potential technology stocks at a discount, and it's on my watch list right now.
Although I think these both look appealing right now, it's important to emphasize that I'm saying that from a long-term perspective. I have no idea what the market, or these two funds, will do over the coming weeks or months, and if we get more market volatility, it's entirely possible they could fall further. However, if you measure your investment returns in periods of multiple years, now could be a great time to take a closer look.

Meta Platforms Inc META shares came under pressure in 2022 due to cost concerns after the company rebranded from Facebook and laid out a new vision for the future focused on the metaverse. The stock has regained momentum over the past couple of years, surging to new highs as the company leaned into AI.
Although Meta’s metaverse ambitions are not currently in focus for the Street, Meta continues to develop virtual reality and augmented reality technologies needed to bring the metaverse idea to consumers. Meta reported operating losses for Reality Labs of approximately $5 billion last quarter. The company continues to attract VR employees with outrageous salaries. 
What To Know: According to a Washington Post report citing people familiar with the matter, Meta is paying programmers capable of creating virtual reality-related tech abnormally high amounts ranging from $600,000 to nearly $1 million annually. 
Meta is paying “significantly more” than most other gaming companies, according to Patrick McAdams, CEO of Andiamo, a data-driven tech recruiting firm.
“It's not an exaggeration to say that their total compensation is double or more than double of what you'll get at a large gaming company,” McAdams said.
Meta spent approximately $10 billion on its metaverse build out in 2021, another $15.9 billion for its Reality Labs division in 2022, another $16 billion in 2023 and approximately $17.7 billion last year. 
Why It Matters: It appears a significant portion of its metaverse and VR spending is going toward offering eye-popping pay packages to programmers. The report indicates that Meta is willing to pay “unusually high salaries” in order to get the best developers to work for the company instead of for competitors. 
A former recruiter for the Mark Zuckerberg-led company told the Washington Post that there usually wasn’t much competition on the offers they made because they would “pay way above market rate” for several roles.

Of all the VR developers that were offered jobs at Meta in recent years, the average compensation was nearly $540,000. For comparison, Apple Inc’s AAPL highest pay packages for VR developers were a little below $500,000 and Alphabet Inc GOOG reportedly paid its top-tier developers approximately $440,000. 
One executive from a smaller gaming company said he was unable to hire a senior developer last year because Meta had offered the candidate $800,000 per year with a performance bonus that could see total compensation rise to about $1 million. 
“This candidate was a senior [developer who didn't have] super unique experience [or] skills. Facebook was doing pretty wild stuff a year ago,” the executive reportedly said.
META Price Action: Meta shares are up approximately 6.65% since the start of 2025, according to Benzinga Pro.

Amidst the fast-paced and highly competitive business environment of today, conducting comprehensive company analysis is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple AAPL in comparison to its major competitors within the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By analyzing critical financial metrics, market position, and growth potential, our objective is to provide valuable insights for investors and offer a deeper understanding of company's performance in the industry.
Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.
When closely examining Apple, the following trends emerge: 
At 35.52, the stock's Price to Earnings ratio significantly exceeds the industry average by 1.05x, suggesting a premium valuation relative to industry peers.
The elevated Price to Book ratio of 50.35 relative to the industry average by 9.41x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.
The Price to Sales ratio of 8.65, which is 5.12x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.
The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 58.74%, which is 50.21% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.
The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $45.91 Billion, which is 117.72x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.
With higher gross profit of $58.27 Billion, which indicates 73.76x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.
The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 3.95% compared to the industry average of 21.47%, which indicates a challenging sales environment.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company.
Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
When comparing Apple with its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be observed:
Compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45, indicating a balanced financial structure.
This suggests that the company maintains a reasonable level of debt while also leveraging equity financing.
For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency relative to its industry competitors.

Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
The SPY is currently trading near our pivotal mark of 574.65. Buyers must initially push prices above 575.67 to demonstrate momentum. If buying persists above this area, expect bulls to challenge the next critical zone at 576.62. Maintaining strength at 576.62 through the trading session could propel SPY upward, targeting resistance at 577.87. Our top bullish goal today for SPY is set at 579.12.
Should 574.65 fail as support, sellers will aim lower, challenging 573.50 to test bullish commitment. A breach here would likely accelerate bearish action, driving price toward 572.15. Persistent selling momentum beneath this level would next target the critical support at 571.06. On a particularly aggressive selling day, SPY could reach our ultimate bearish objective of 569.98.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
The QQQ is presently hovering around our essential price of 493.60. Bulls need to maintain and stabilize price action here, pushing higher to reclaim 495.35 decisively. If successful, bullish traders could drive prices upward to challenge 496.94 next. With sustained buying strength, further gains toward 498.37 become likely, putting our peak bullish target for today at 499.44 within reach.
If bulls fail to defend 493.60 intraday, expect bearish pressure to quickly drive prices toward the downside level at 491.82. Continued weakness could extend declines to 490.05, with further aggressive selling potentially targeting support at 487.69. A failure to stabilize here could cause prices to tumble further toward our low bearish target today at 486.10.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is currently trading close to our crucial pivot at 223.87. Buyers must secure this as reliable support, creating momentum toward the next upside target at 225.31. Should bullish participants continue to dominate price action, Apple shares could advance further to test 226.08. If momentum remains robust throughout the session, expect Apple to challenge our primary bullish target today at 226.90.
If price action fails to maintain 223.87 intraday, selling pressure will likely push Apple lower, initially targeting 222.96. Continued weakness would encourage bearish traders to seek further downside toward 222.24. If selling pressure persists below this area, expect Apple to test support at 221.66, potentially falling further toward today’s lower bearish target at 220.97.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft is currently navigating around our key intraday level of 394.46. Bullish momentum must emerge above this level, lifting the price to test the next significant zone at 395.68, which bulls must maintain decisively as support. Achieving stability here could generate a continued upward move to challenge 397.65. With sustained bullish engagement, Microsoft could reach today’s bullish target of 398.38.
If Microsoft falters at 394.46, sellers will likely apply pressure, testing support at 393.47. A clear breakdown below this area would indicate weakening momentum, targeting lower levels at 392.49. If bears gain stronger momentum, price action might extend declines toward 390.98, with our bottom bearish objective today established at 389.29.
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
NVIDIA currently trades around our crucial mark of 119.44. Bulls must rapidly advance the price to test and reclaim support at 120.27. Successful bullish action here could fuel a drive higher, targeting 121.97 next. Continued strong buying throughout today’s session could carry NVIDIA toward further resistance at 123.41, ultimately approaching our high bullish goal today of 125.21.
Should NVIDIA fail to maintain stability at 119.44, bears will press the price downward, initially targeting 117.86. Continued selling below this level could further weaken the market, leading NVIDIA toward support at 116.61. Persistent downside action may extend toward 115.83, with an aggressive bearish scenario placing today’s lowest target at 115.15.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is currently trading around our crucial pivot of 169.34. Bulls need to firmly hold this level to build upward momentum toward 171.14. Sustained bullish activity here could propel Alphabet’s price toward our primary bullish target for the session at 172.28.
A failure at 169.34 during today's trading would trigger bearish momentum, driving Alphabet initially toward 167.04. Increased selling could lead to further downside action toward 165.41. Persistent bearish strength could ultimately push Alphabet toward our lowest bearish target today at 163.79.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is presently positioned around our important intraday level of 629.88. Buyers need to establish firm support here, launching price action toward 635.49. Sustained buying activity could further elevate Meta shares toward 642.59. Continued bullish conviction today would enable traders to push prices toward our ultimate bullish target at 646.48.
Should Meta fail to secure 629.88 as intraday support, sellers will target the lower support at 622.01. Continued bearish activity could further pressure price toward 615.65. In the event of sustained selling intensity, bears may ultimately drive prices down to today’s bearish target at 609.30.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is currently trading around our significant pivot level of 283.95. Bulls should actively push price above this zone to initially challenge 286.34. With ongoing bullish activity, price momentum could reach higher resistance at 288.80. If overall market strength remains supportive, Tesla may extend its rally toward 290.47. Exceptional bullish interest could propel prices to our upper bullish objective for Tesla today at 293.21.
If bulls are unable to secure 283.95 as firm support, anticipate bearish traders driving Tesla toward lower levels starting at 281.32. Continued bearish pressure would likely encourage further selling toward 279.43. A clear breakdown below this support could result in aggressive selling, ultimately targeting our lowest bearish objective for Tesla today at 278.11.
Final Word:
Today's economic calendar is relatively sparse but still noteworthy. At 8:30 AM ET, markets receive the Preliminary Durable Goods Orders and Preliminary Capital Goods Orders data for February, providing insight into the underlying health of the manufacturing and industrial sectors. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury will conduct auctions at 11:30 AM ET for the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes, followed by the 5-Year FRN auction at 1 PM ET. Traders should also pay attention to scheduled Federal Reserve commentary, starting with non-voter Kashkari at 10 AM ET, and more significantly, voting member Musalem at 1:10 PM ET, whose remarks could influence market perceptions on the Fed's future policy stance.
Given these events, traders should anticipate volatility during auction windows and Federal Reserve commentary, adjusting risk accordingly. Manage positions carefully, remain disciplined, and ensure proper risk protocols are followed. Good luck trading today!

Key Points
The Nasdaq Composite is down 9.1% this year and back on Monday morning it was still trading in correction territory. Several stocks have been bouncing back, but there are still some intriguing buys available right now that may set you up for some strong returns in the future.
Three stocks that are trading down at least 5% since the start of 2025 and that have a lot of upside are Alphabet (GOOG -1.46%) (GOOGL -1.41%), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD -3.47%), and Apple (AAPL 0.89%). Here's why you shouldn't hesitate to buy these tech stocks for the long haul.
As of Tuesday afternoon, Alphabet's stock was down 10.2% since the start of the year. Concerns around tariffs and worsening economic conditions are weighing on its business, as are other factors.
The company recently announced plans to buy cybersecurity tech company Wiz for $32 billion. The move would dramatically expand Alphabet's offerings and equip it with a new growth opportunity. However, oftentimes when there's an acquisition, shares of the acquiring company fall as investors worry about valuation. Another potential issue weighing on Alphabet stock is the threat of a government-mandated breakup. Investors may have been hoping that under President Donald Trump, the government may be more friendly to the tech industry concerning antitrust measures. But the Department of Justice is reportedly still calling for the breakup of the tech giant due to its monopoly, which may lead to it selling its Chrome browser.
Alphabet's stock is trading at a relatively modest 21 times its trailing earnings, which looks cheap. The acquisition of Wiz may result in significant growth opportunities for the business. And while a breakup may sound like bad news, it may not necessarily turn out that way. Some analysts believe it could unlock more value through higher individual valuations for its various business segments, and by allowing separate business units to operate more efficiently.
As a leading company in not only search but also video sharing, and with more growth opportunities out there to pursue in cloud computing, Alphabet still looks like an unstoppable investment to buy and hold for the long term.
Chipmaking company Advanced Micro Devices, also known as AMD, is trading down the least on this list, just 5.5% this year as of Tuesday afternoon. But its decline has been going on for a while as it's down over 36% in the past 12 months. While the chipmaker should be doing better amid the growth in artificial intelligence (AI), it has been overshadowed by its more dominant rival, Nvidia.
Question marks about how competitive AMD's AI chips will be against Nvidia have left some investors on the sidelines. But given just how massive the market may be, there's going to be significant demand for AI chips, and there's going to be plenty of room for multiple companies to do well and grow. Estimates from Grand View Research project that by 2030, the AI chip market will be worth more than $323 billion -- up from $71 billion in 2024. 
As dominant as Nvidia is today, investors shouldn't forget about AMD. Its growth rate has been picking up, with sales growing by 24% year over year for the last three months of last year, as its top line hit $7.7 billion. AMD may be lagging behind Nvidia but with a lot more growth still on the horizon for the company, this may be one of the most underrated AI stocks to buy right now.
One company that may be lagging in AI even more than AMD is Apple. Investors and consumers alike have been frustrated with its slow rollout of AI capabilities on its new phones. The company has restructured its AI team after recently announcing that new AI features for its assistant, Siri, won't be coming until next year. 
It's bad news for Apple in the short run, but it's not a development I'd be too concerned about as an investor. Unless Apple customers are disgruntled enough that they are going to leave the entire ecosystem and go to Android (which Alphabet owns), then it's likely not going to have a devastating effect on the business over the long haul. The company has often lagged behind rivals when it comes to launching new tech features and while being slow with AI features is disappointing, it doesn't change the fact that this is a hugely profitable business with a massive, loyal customer base. Over the trailing 12 months, Apple has reported more than $96 billion in profit.
Apple's stock is down 10.7% this year as of Tuesday afternoon, but odds are the business will recover from the current headwinds. This is still an excellent growth stock to buy and forget about.

Key Points
Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B 0.02%) (BRK.A 0.06%) has been a fantastic investment over the years. The investment holding company has generated a 13.7% annualized return over the past decade. That has easily surpassed the S&P 500's 10.6% annualized return. 
Warren Buffett's company is in an excellent position to continue growing value for its shareholders in the future. Here are three reasons to buy Berkshire Hathaway stock without hesitation right now.
At its core, Berkshire Hathaway is a holding company for a diverse array of great businesses it owns outright. The company's operating businesses include insurance companies, a railroad, utilities, manufacturing businesses, service companies, and retail operations. Some of its notable brands are GEICO, BNSF, Pilot Travel Centers, Fruit of the Loom, and See's Candies. 
These operating companies generate strong and growing earnings for Berkshire. Last quarter, the company produced a record $14.5 billion of operating earnings. That was up 71% compared to the year-ago period, partly because of a one-time currency gain. After adjusting for that item, its operating profit was still up more than 40% to $13.3 billion. A big driver was the improvement in the profitability of GEICO insurance. 
Berkshire's strong and growing operating businesses should continue to grow shareholder value as they increase their earnings. That will give Berkshire more cash to reinvest as it sees fit, including buying more operating businesses as attractive opportunities arise. 
Berkshire Hathaway also uses its retained earnings and the float from its insurance operations (i.e., money held by its insurance businesses that they haven't yet paid out in claims) to invest in high-quality publicly traded stocks. Berkshire Hathaway owns nearly 50 stocks worth almost $290 billion. 
Over 70% of Berkshire's investment portfolio is in six stocks: 
Berkshire's investment portfolio generates dividend income. It's also a source of cash, as Berkshire can sell shares if it needs to raise cash to pay insurance claims or fund the purchase of a new operating company investment. The portfolio also helps grow value for shareholders who benefit from the rising values of the stocks Berkshire owns. 
Berkshire Hathaway generates a tremendous amount of cash from its operating businesses and its investment portfolio. The company had a staggering $334 billion of cash on its balance sheet at the end of its last quarter. That was a record cash pile for the company. 
The company's cash position has been on the rise because Buffett and his team have been trimming some of their stock positions. Last year, the company sold more than $134 million in stock, largely by selling down its positions in Apple and Bank of America. 
Berkshire has a massive war chest for Buffett and his team to allocate toward creating more value for shareholders. They could use that money to make a needle-moving deal to add a new operating company to its portfolio. They could capitalize on a stock market sell-off to buy more shares of high-quality companies at lower prices. They could also buy back a big chunk of Berkshire's stock if it trades at a compelling level. 
Berkshire Hathaway is a wealth-creating machine. The company owns a diversified portfolio of operating companies that produce strong and growing earnings. That gives it the cash to buy new operating businesses and invest in high-quality publicly traded stocks when it sees compelling opportunities. In the meantime, cash is piling up on its balance sheet, giving Berkshire a massive war chest to pounce when the right opportunity arises. This trio of value drivers is the reason Berkshire Hathaway is a great stock to buy right now without having to worry about the future.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.'s TSM $165 billion U.S. expansion is reportedly driven by geopolitical pressure, supply chain security, and customer demands, but it comes with major risks for Taiwan. 
What Happened: TSMC’s accelerated U.S. expansion aims to meet the demands of American clients like Apple Inc. AAPL and Nvidia Corp.NVDA.
However, experts warn that Taiwan’s strategic importance could diminish as the U.S. increases its share in global chip production, reported Nikkei Asia.
Earlier this month, TSMC announced an additional $100 billion investment to build five new chip facilities and an R&D center in the U.S.
The self-governed island has relied on its “Silicon shield” for protection, but the U.S. is now home to TSMC’s first overseas cutting-edge plant in Arizona.
See Also: Intel ‘Will Be Fighting For Every Socket' In The Data Center Business, Says Co-CEO Michelle Holthaus As Competition From AMD, Nvidia Heats Up
Konrad Young, a former R&D director at TSMC and former senior advisor at Intel, said that Taiwan should move beyond the “silicon shield” concept and avoid linking its strategic significance solely to a single company or industry.
He stressed the need for Taiwan to establish “multiple shields” to showcase its broader value to governments worldwide.
Why It's Important: The expansion of TSMC in the U.S. has sparked a series of geopolitical and economic concerns.
Last month, China accused Taiwan of potentially surrendering its semiconductor industry to the U.S. for political support. This accusation comes amid rumors of TSMC’s potential stake in Intel Corp. INTC.
Moreover, Taiwan’s government has also scrutinized TSMC’s overseas ventures, saying that they require permission for joint ventures abroad.
Previously, the U.S. has also expressed concerns over Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies’ access to TSMC chips.
Despite these challenges, TSMC’s Chairman CC Wei earlier this month said that the U.S. expansion is driven by the booming demand for AI and smartphone technologies, not political pressure.
Price Action: TSMC’s stock inched up 0.32% in after-hours trading, reaching $181.48. Earlier on Tuesday, it closed at $180.90, slipping 0.14% during regular trading. So far this year, the company’s shares have declined 10.26%, according to data from Benzinga Pro.

Key Points
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks have been incredibly successful stock picks, but most have sold off so far in 2025, some heavily. Their lower prices are intriguing, but I don't think all of them make great buys right now. While five look great, I'm avoiding two. 

GOOGL data by YCharts
I wouldn't buy any Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) stock right now. These two companies have problems.
Apple hasn't realized a game-changing or innovative product in some time, and has failed to grow its revenue meaningfully over the past three years. It finally surpassed the trailing-12-month total set in the fall of 2022 this past quarter, and Wall Street analysts project only 4.6% and 8% growth in FY 2025 and FY 2026, respectively. On top of that, Apple has a premium valuation compared to the other stocks (only Amazon and Tesla trade at a higher forward price-to-earnings ratio, and Microsoft's is equal). As a result, I want to avoid Apple.
Tesla is having some brand issues, which can be directly tied to CEO Elon Musk's involvement in President Donald Trump's administration. Whether you agree with his actions or not, it's indisputable that some Tesla owners and potential buyers are angry. Until Tesla gets its brand image straightened out, I'll probably avoid the stock.
The remaining five stocks on this list are Nvidia (NVDA -1.42%), Microsoft (MSFT -0.04%), Alphabet (GOOG -1.38%) (GOOGL -1.41%), Meta Platforms (META -0.92%), and Amazon (AMZN 0.41%), and each looks intriguing at its current price tag.
Following the recent sell-off, these five stocks are down 15%-20% from their highs. Alongside that, each is trading near relative valuation lows from the past three years.

GOOGL data by YCharts

GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts
Alphabet is by far the cheapest at 19 times forward earnings -- a metric that uses analyst estimates -- which prices it well below the S&P 500's (SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) 20.5 forward P/E. I believe growth rates that are projected to be above market pace for the next few years make Alphabet a no-brainer buy. 
The other four stocks trade at a premium to the S&P 500, so they need convincing growth estimates to justify that premium to me.
While Nvidia is one of the more expensive stocks of the five, it's also projected to grow the fastest. Wall Street analysts project that Nvidia will grow its revenue by 57% in FY 2026 (the current year) and 23% in the next fiscal year, far outpacing the 10% the S&P 500 averages.
On top of that, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sees a path to $1 trillion in data center revenue by 2028, a potentially magnificent boon for his company, making today's stock price look like an absolute steal. 
Microsoft and Amazon also make for great buys (and Alphabet as well) because of their exposure to cloud computing. Cloud computing is a key beneficiary of the AI arms race, as many companies don't have the computing power necessary to run AI models, so they rent that power from a cloud computing provider.
Amazon Web Services (AWS), Azure (Microsoft's platform), and Google Cloud (Alphabet's platform) are the largest cloud computing providers by market share and will benefit from a huge spending wave that's expected to expand the cloud computing market opportunity from $752 billion in 2024 to $2.4 trillion in 2030. This is monstrous growth and could easily propel these stocks into market-beating territory.
Last on this list is Meta, which has been a huge spender in the AI arms race. Meta uses AI to maintain its dominance in the social media space, where it generates nearly all of its revenue from ads on those platforms. Meta also has several exciting projects that it's working on in its Reality Labs division. Meta's revenue could take off if a new sales stream emerges should any of these become a hit product. Even without that, its revenue is expected to increase by 15% in 2025 and 14% in 2026, which makes it a great stock to own if you're trying to beat the market. 
The ""Magnificent Seven"" stocks are still relevant in today's market, but you need to be selective about which ones you buy. The latest market sell-off is a great chance to scoop up some of them on sale, and I'm willing to bet that at least some them will beat the market over the next three to five years.

AAPL,"Big Tech Companies Employ Majority Of H-1B Visa Workers: Where Do Amazon, Google, Meta Rank? - Amazon.com  ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) ",20250325,Neutral,0.14592,"Amazon tops the list with 11,000 H-1B visa approvals in 2023. Google comes in fifth place and employed almost 5,550 H-1B workers in 2023, less than half compared to Amazon.",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/government/regulations/25/03/44485001/big-tech-companies-employ-majority-of-h-1b-visa-workers-where-do-amazon-google-meta-rank,"Benzinga Rankings give you vital metrics on any stock – anytime.
Big tech companies are employing the majority of approved H-1B visa workers in the U.S., according to research from the Pew Research Center.  Here's a look at which companies top the list.
Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN came in first with 11,000 H-1B visa approvals in 2023, marking the third consecutive year the e-commerce giant topped the list. Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp. CTSH, Infosys Ltd. INFY and Tata Consultancy Services, Inc. round out the top four.

Alphabet, Inc.'s GOOG GOOGL Google came in fifth place and employed almost 5,550 H-1B workers in 2023, less than half compared to Amazon.
Microsoft Corp. MSFT followed in sixth with nearly 4,800 workers and Apple Inc. AAPL came in right behind at 3,800.
Meta Platforms, Inc. META came in eighth place with 3,371 H-1B workers and currently faces a lawsuit claiming the company systematically favors foreign workers. 
Plaintiffs in the case argue that Meta has a pattern of prioritizing visa holders for employment, a claim supported by court-cited statistics: 15% of Meta’s U.S. workforce holds H-1B visas, compared to 0.5% across all industries.
Meta has denied the allegations and called the discrimination claims “baseless.”
Tesla, Inc. TSLA ranked near the bottom of the 30 companies on Pew Research's list with less than 1,100 H-1B visas, accounting for 0.3% of total H-1B approvals. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has been an outspoken proponent of the visa program, likening it to drafting talented foreign players to bolster an NBA team. 
The H-1B program, established in 1990, enables U.S. employers to recruit skilled foreign professionals with bachelor's degrees or equivalent qualifications for specialized roles. 
H1-B visas are initially valid for three years, renewable up to six years, with potential extensions for those pursuing permanent residency. In 2023, 400,000 H-1B applications were approved with 65% of approvals being renewals.

Market Mechanics Driving Stocks
Please click here for an enlarged chart of SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) which represents the benchmark stock market index S&P 500 (SPX).
Note the following:
After a rip-roaring rally, Chinese stocks, notably AI stocks, are beginning to see money outflows.
In the early trade, money flows are positive in Apple Inc (AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN), Alphabet Inc Class C (GOOG), Meta Platforms Inc (META), Microsoft Corp (MSFT), and Tesla Inc (TSLA).
In the early trade, money flows are negative in NVIDIA Corp (NVDA) on the warning from Joe Tsai.
In the early trade, money flows are positive in (SPY) and Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ).
Investors can gain an edge by knowing money flows in SPY and QQQ.  Investors can get a bigger edge by knowing when smart money is buying stocks, gold, and oil.  The most popular ETF for gold is SPDR Gold Trust (GLD).  The most popular ETF for silver is iShares Silver Trust (SLV).  The most popular ETF for oil is United States Oil ETF (USO).
Bitcoin is seeing buying.
It is important for investors to look ahead and not in the rearview mirror.  The proprietary protection band from The Arora Report puts all of the data, all of the indicators, all of the news, all of the crosscurrents, all of the models, and all of the analysis in an analytical framework that is easily actionable by investors. 
Consider continuing to hold good, very long term, existing positions. Based on individual risk preference, consider a protection band consisting of cash or Treasury bills or short-term tactical trades as well as short to medium term hedges and short term hedges. This is a good way to protect yourself and participate in the upside at the same time.
You can determine your protection bands by adding cash to hedges.  The high band of the protection is appropriate for those who are older or conservative. The low band of the protection is appropriate for those who are younger or aggressive.  If you do not hedge, the total cash level should be more than stated above but significantly less than cash plus hedges.
A protection band of 0% would be very bullish and would indicate full investment with 0% in cash.  A protection band of 100% would be very bearish and would indicate a need for aggressive protection with cash and hedges or aggressive short selling.
It is worth reminding that you cannot take advantage of new upcoming opportunities if you are not holding enough cash.  When adjusting hedge levels, consider adjusting partial stop quantities for stock positions (non ETF); consider using wider stops on remaining quantities and also allowing more room for high beta stocks.  High beta stocks are the ones that move more than the market.
Probability based risk reward adjusted for inflation does not favor long duration strategic bond allocation at this time.
Those who want to stick to traditional 60% allocation to stocks and 40% to bonds may consider focusing on only high quality bonds and bonds of five year duration or less.  Those willing to bring sophistication to their investing may consider using bond ETFs as tactical positions and not strategic positions at this time.

In today's rapidly changing and fiercely competitive business landscape, it is essential for investors and industry enthusiasts to thoroughly analyze companies. In this article, we will conduct a comprehensive industry comparison, evaluating Apple AAPL against its key competitors in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry. By examining key financial metrics, market position, and growth prospects, we aim to provide valuable insights for investors and shed light on company's performance within the industry.
Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality. The firm designs its own software and semiconductors while working with subcontractors like Foxconn and TSMC to build its products and chips. Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution.
When closely examining Apple, the following trends emerge: 
The current Price to Earnings ratio of 35.04 is 1.03x higher than the industry average, indicating the stock is priced at a premium level according to the market sentiment.
The elevated Price to Book ratio of 49.67 relative to the industry average by 9.23x suggests company might be overvalued based on its book value.
The Price to Sales ratio of 8.53, which is 5.02x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.
The company has a higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 58.74%, which is 50.21% above the industry average. This suggests efficient use of equity to generate profits and demonstrates profitability and growth potential.
With higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $45.91 Billion, which is 117.72x above the industry average, the company demonstrates stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.
The gross profit of $58.27 Billion is 73.76x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.
The company's revenue growth of 3.95% is significantly below the industry average of 21.47%. This suggests a potential struggle in generating increased sales volume.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio is an important measure to assess the financial structure and risk profile of a company.
Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
By analyzing Apple in relation to its top 4 peers based on the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following insights can be derived:
When compared to its top 4 peers, Apple has a moderate debt-to-equity ratio of 1.45.
This implies that the company maintains a balanced financial structure with a reasonable level of debt and an appropriate reliance on equity financing.
For Apple in the Technology Hardware, Storage & Peripherals industry, the PE, PB, and PS ratios are all high compared to its peers, indicating that the stock may be overvalued. On the other hand, Apple's high ROE, EBITDA, gross profit, and low revenue growth suggest strong profitability and operational efficiency relative to industry competitors.

Dylan Lewis: We're parsing the words of Jerome Powell and Jensen Huang. This week's Motley Fool Money radio show starts now.
From Fool Global headquarters. This is Motley Fool Money.
It's the Motley Fool Money Radio Show. I'm Dylan Lewis. Joining me over the airwaves, Motley Fool senior analysts Jason Moser and Asit Sharma. Fools, wonderful to have you both here.
Jason Moser: Howdy.
Asit Sharma: Hey, Dylan.
Dylan Lewis: We've got the latest and greatest in AI from Nvidia, how a company focused on infrastructure projects is thinking about the tariff impact and, of course, the stocks on your radar this week. We're going to pick up Talking Fed, though. Jerome Powell and company got together to take a look at the economy that gave us thoughts on rates, economic outlook, inflation. Jason. Where were you paying attention?
Jason Moser: It's only March, but it sure feels like we've gotten a year's worth of volatility in the markets already. Certainly could be worse, S&P down around 3% so far this year, and that really is impressive. But you consider all of the magnificent seven stocks, save one are underperforming the market to date here. I just think that's an interesting perspective there on the markets, which leads us to then exactly how the fed is viewing things and they didn't exactly paint the rosiest picture. There are concerns of slowing growth and unemployment and stubborn prices, those concerns remain. Hear that the word stagflation being bandied about a little bit. But it is a very headline driven market.
Things are seemingly changing by the hour. I think it was noteworthy I saw an interview with the Chicago Federal Reserve President, Austan Goolsbee, who said that he still sees interest rate cuts coming, but there are rising risks to that. In the market right now, we've been hearing the Feds laying out this plan of two rate cuts this year. Now, there are other thoughts out there that we might see even more, three, perhaps. But generally speaking, the idea is that in the next 12-18 months, we should see rates coming down from where they are today. It just all depends on how all of this tariff stuff plays out ultimately and how things impact the economy. But there's no doubt there is a lot of uncertainty out there, a lot of trepidation. Businesses they're cutting back spending. They're holding off on big decisions, and that is having some ripple effects.
Dylan Lewis: It seems like there's a bit of wait and see all around. Consumers, businesses, the fed saying we are going to hold steady this round. We aren't going to make any changes. One thing that did jump out to me, Asit, I want to get your take on Jerome Powell saying, ""We do understand that sentiment has fallen off pretty sharply, but economic activity has not yet. The economy seems to be pretty healthy. What do you think of that?
Asit Sharma: I think it's a tough place for Jerome Powell and the Fed to be in because they still see an economy which is growing. They've clipped their internal estimates, I think, to around 1.7%. That's down from, if you heard two percentage points of growth or more. The economy is slowing. They see that, but it's not like it's coming to a standstill and this is where you get into a hard spot if you're making the decision because inflation is still persistent, so you have to be careful, which brings into question.
What Jason is pointing out here, if the fed is going to have three quarters of a percentage point of cuts this year, they better get busy. Because the fed likes to do quarter percentage increments, if they can. That means the next three quarters, they have to deliver what we might see as Jason was alluding to something in between where, maybe it's three quarters of a percentage point, or it's just half a percentage point because they're in this limbo. My bets are on the last two quarters of the year. We see a quarter percentage point cut each. But I'm glad that I have this day job and not Jerome Powell.
Dylan Lewis: I think we're all happy that we're doing what we're doing, and we're not sitting in that fed chair seat. Folks love to micro analyze the comments from Fed Chair Powell. Same goes for Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang. He is like the fed chair of AI, [LAUGHTER] if I may. He took the stage this week at Nvidia's GTC conference to talk about the company's chip offerings, what's coming up on their roadmap. Jason also gave a little bit of a Mea Culpa on some quantum computing comments that he made earlier this year.
Jason Moser: It seems like the Nvidia events are supplanting Apple. Now it's all about the Nvidia event and they used to do this once every two years. Now I think they're going to be going just on an annual cadence, which I think that makes a lot of sense. Nvidia is turning into this iPhone cycle, only a little bit more accelerated, isn't it? We're waiting each quarter and each year for them to reveal their next iteration in their GPUs and AI technology. This event really brought a lot to the table. Some was expected. I think there were some new things we learned, which was interesting. Robotics was a key theme of the event there. They had demonstrations and announcements related to their AI powered robotics platforms that ultimately is just working to bring AI, ultimately, into the physical world more. I thought really, we knew about Blackwell Ultra. That wasn't terribly new news.
But there was some interesting information they gave us on what's to be released here in the back half of 2026. It's the Vera Rubin system. This ultimately has two main components. It's a CPU called Vera, and then a new GPU design called Rubin. In fun fact here, it's named after American astronomer Vera Rubin. But this is Nvidia's first custom CPU design. It's based on a core design they've named Olympus. Ultimately, this is going to be something the Vera design is going to be twice as fast as the CPU that was used in last year's Blackwell chips. Like I said, they expect to start shipping these in the second half of 2026. It's going to be fun to continue following Nvidia because they do have to keep that hamster wheel of innovation going.
They always have to come out with something new, and that's impressive because it seems like they can do it. The risk is, with these types of companies, what happens if that innovation stalls or what happens when we hit peak AI, and we're getting the most value out of it, and we have to wait for the next revolution there. But for now, it sure seems like Nvidia is continuing to bring the goods.
Dylan Lewis: Asit, what caught your attention from the event?
Asit Sharma: I think this cadence that Jason mentioned was fun to look at. That is one thing everyone was expecting to see the next generations announced. I'll just point out in addition to what Jason said that Vera Rubin and its successor, the Vera and Rubin and Ultra, both are taking a step up in the type of complex memory that's used. They're going from what's called an HBM3 standard to an HBM4 standard. Which means that you can have much more computation on those chip GPU complexes. That was interesting. They talked about expanding the communication between GPUs. This is called NVLink scaling, how that is ramping up. It's going to double from the previous generation of Blackwell to this new Vera Rubin generation.
Getting us out of the technical details, though for a second, I think the quantum stuff was interesting, as you point out, Dylan you asked about, I am very interested in the quantum space. The Mea Culpa was nice to see because Jensen Huang's company in Nvidia stands to make money if they can marry up artificial intelligence compute with quantum. There's some problems in this whole quantum race that will probably be solved or better solved using AI. Of course, Nvidia wants to be there. Now he has to talk it up and pull the timescale back a bit from his previous comments that it would be 15-20 years away. We got to see a fun quantum day type symposium on Thursday. Looking forward to more quantum focused efforts from Nvidia in the future because they got to take that revenue when it's available.
Dylan Lewis: Another week, another Tesla headline. The Financial Times out with a piece this week detailing some accounting curiosities with Tesla's books noting that $1.4 billion seems to be missing. Asit, you are our resident CPA. Can you dust off your accounting books and wade through this one? There are no shortage of risks and maybe things weighing on Tesla's shareholders' minds. Where does this one rank for you?
Asit Sharma: I think for me, this is just one of different risk items that you want to look at if you're a Tesla shareholder. It's not necessarily a huge deal. I know it sounds salacious out there in the press, and I've had some fun as an armchair quarterback, trying to figure out what might be going on. The basic issue is that Tesla had some capital expenditures, but the corresponding amount isn't showing up as new fixed assets on its books. I've thought through some scenarios where look, this could be just a misclassification of how they're accounting for stuff can be fixed.
When you look at the big picture for Tesla, I think that's much more the concern here for most shareholders, which has to do with the resale value of Tesla's plummeting. We're hearing stories of panels falling off of cyber trucks. Of course, all the issues that are associated with Elon Musk's association with government policy, how that might be affecting the company and his statements. Now, I will say, look, the counter to that is last night, Elon had town hall with the troops and said, The future is still bright. From my perspective, we're going forward with the robotaxis with autonomous driving, so hang in there. If you're Tessa shareholder and you believe that long term thesis, that probably was reassuring to you.
Dylan Lewis: Coming up after the break, we've got fresh results from Nike, FedEx and Accenture. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money I'm Dylan Lewis. Here on air with Asit Sharma and Jason Moser, and we're back on the earnings beat. Shares of FedEx down almost 10% following their earnings release this week. Asit feels like some of the tariff news swirling into a little bit of a rough outlook for this company.
Asit Sharma: I think that's exactly what it is, Dylan. FedEx reported earnings that were OK on the surface. Revenue was flattish at 22 billion. Operating income looked a lot like the previous year quarter at about $1.3 billion, and operating margin was a little bit lower by about a percentage point versus the prior year. Just looking at their headline numbers and their press release, nothing too much shifted there, but the outlook is uncertain, and it disappointed at Wall Street. Revenue is going to be flat to slightly down this year. Diluted earnings per share of around 15.15 or 15 bucks and 15 cents to a top of the range of close to 16 bucks. That was disappointing to Wall Street.
I think overarching this is just the fear that between tariffs, as you alluded to, which could really hurt FedEx, the potential that we could go into recession, which is never good for FedEx volumes and some uncertainty around this de minimis exemption, which could go away. I'm referring, of course, to the ability for shippers like Chan and Temu in China to export stuff to the US and not have to pay import duties if those shipments go directly to consumers and are under 800 bucks. Those small shipments, if those go away without the exemption, that could be a further hit on this business. I think FedEx is getting a trifecta of uncertainty from investors, and honestly, it probably deserves a little bit of multiple rerating. That is, maybe we pay a little bit less for future earnings because of all this uncertainty.
Dylan Lewis: In addition to the earnings release, there was also an analyst downgrade out this week. There was a note out from Loop Capital Analyst, Rick Patterson, and he summed all that up by saying,""It is a really bad recession stock."" Asit. lain and simple. When shipment volumes go down, when economic outlook and fewer packages are going out there, it is just going to bite FedEx. It's inevitable.
Asit Sharma: Let me put it this way. It's a really good recession stock if you don't own it. If you go into a recession, that might be the time to buy and hang on for a few years. He's not overly wrong there.
Dylan Lewis: Maybe a similar story with Nike. Shares also in the red this week down about 6% after the company reported another period of sales decline. We have been wondering, Jason, when is Nike going to turn it around? It seems like the answer is not quite yet.
Jason Moser: I was just going to say, let the turnaround begin, Dylan, that's what we're hoping for here. The numbers certainly were not impressive. I will say they are better than the leadership guided for a quarter ago. That's always nice to see. It makes you wonder if this isn't a leadership team that maybe kind of sandbags. I guess we'll have to wait and see. But revenue of $11.3 billion, it was down 9% from a year ago, earnings per share of 54 cents down from 77 cents from a year ago. Gross margin fell 330 basis points. That was within the range that leadership guided for 300-350 basis points there. Wholesale revenues a big point of friction for the company. Those were down 9%.
If you look at just the important segments, geographically speaking, North America was down 4%, China was down 15%. They did certainly talk to the concerns of tariffs and items goods that they have to import from places like Mexico and China. I think the market probably is a little bit more down on the guidance. They did guide for this Quarter 4 revenue to be down in the mid teens range. Again, we go back to maybe this is a sandbagging leadership. I don't know, but we will find out the next quarter when they announce, but I think that we will see margins continue to be challenged, 400-500 basis point dip they're talking about this coming quarter.
Again, the tariff concerns will continue. I think look, Elliott Hill, who is the new CEO here for this company, he has his work cut out for him and investors are going to need to give him some time to execute. I'm an IQ shareholder. I'm perfectly happy to give him the time to do that. Shares, still I feel like there's a pretty attractive valuation here for such a powerful global brand. Somewhere in that neighborhood of 20-21 times earnings right now for a company that has historically garnered a more premium multiple and you get a nice dividend to sit there and be patient, I don't have a problem with hanging in there and seeing how Elliott does.
Dylan Lewis: Management's playing an interesting expectations game here because for the results being what they were, they also sign posted for this upcoming quarter. Their fiscal fourth quarter, is going to reflect the largest impact from a lot of their actions. They are basically saying, there are going to be headwinds that are out of our control. There's a lot of stuff that we still need to do just to get ourselves right with inventory that's going to flow through and affect our business for a while. For people that are interested, Jason, is this one where maybe it makes sense to build out a position over time. There might be a little bit of pain ahead, but working into that position, dollar-cost averaging a bit.
Jason Moser: I think that's always a very reasonable way to look at it. I think with Nike, probably because it's such a big, large, established company and brand, you may not necessarily see these big moves one way or the other. Ultimately, the shares are down about 5% on this earnings report, which, again, wasn't that great. But building out a position in a company like this absolutely is a good way to go because you're. They've got boots on the ground, and they're working to re establish these wholesale relationships, but that's going to take some time, as well. We may see some more pain ahead. I think this next quarter is going to be very telling.
Dylan Lewis: I didn't intend for this earnings rundown to be all red, all downers, [LAUGHTER] but here we are wrapping us up Accenture joining Nike and FedEx down today. Company reported results, markets seem to zoom in on their government business. Asit, they're one of the first companies that we've been able to get a glimpse at the government efficiency efforts and how that might flow through to private companies.
Asit Sharma: This is the hold my beer for the other two earnings stories, Dylan, you think tariffs are bad? We have a company here which actually has such great depth in consulting. It is the world's largest consulting concern, and so surprising that for all the uncertainty we've heard about, the effects not being quantifiable yet for tariffs, on the other side, this government cost cutting initiative, it's quick and it's quantifiable for Accenture. They had a very decent quarter net bookings. That's a decrease in US dollar terms, but flattish, if you take out currency fluctuations. Their generative AI business. They had new bookings of 1.4 billion. That's small in comparison to revenues, which were almost 17 billion this quarter, but it shows the growth of that business.
On the other side, CEO Julie Sweet used the word government like eight times in the transcript, which is not typical and said they said, Look, about 8% of our global revenue and 16% of our America's revenue, in this fiscal year is represented by Accenture Federal Services. When you think about numbers that hit that level of between high single digits and teens, that can be consequential to trim your growth on the margins and that's what we're seeing with this outlook from Accenture. Which is despite the positive parts of their business, if they start getting crimped on what's a very stable and core part of the business, that flattish outlook then starts to look like it could be in jeopardy, and maybe we're faced with a company that for the next several quarters, could be looking at slight declines in revenue and bookings.
Dylan Lewis: I have to imagine we'll see echoes of this when we see reports from some of the other consulting businesses that have government contracts. Anywhere else with that government story that you're paying attention to? Any other industries?
Asit Sharma: It's funny because if you look at where a lot of the opportunity for cybersecurity companies, the best of the breed lies, it's with something called FedRAMP, which is getting your authorizations to do a lot of business with the federal government because your stuff is so secure. I think we might see some headwinds there.
Dylan Lewis: Asit, Jason, fellas, we're going to see you guys a little bit later in the show. Up next, our investing team talks tariff impacts with a company that specializes in the prep and buildout for major infrastructure projects. Stay right here. You're listening to Motley Fool Money.
Welcome back to Motley Fool Money. I'm Dylan Lewis. We like to dig into the weeds here at TMF. Getting into the details and the major themes affecting the companies that we follow. Last week, Motley Fool CEO Tom Gardner and CIO Andy Cross chatted with Joe Cutillo. He's the CEO of Sterling Infrastructure, and they're a firm focused on the preparation for major infrastructure projects. Together, they talk through the business, how the macro picture factors into the company's outlook and the idea of investing like the CEO of a company.
Andy Cross:
Tom Gardner: The opening question is, how would you describe the business to a newcomer, somebody who's never heard of Sterling Infrastructure before. Obviously, a lot of our viewers today are shareholders, but there are certainly some people in the audience that have never heard of the company before, and now they get an opportunity to hear it from you.
Joe Cutillo: We're an infrastructure service provider that focuses in three different segments. Our Eva structure segment is our largest. In that segment, what we do is site selection, site development for mission critical type applications, predominantly, which could be data centers, onshoring and manufacturing. We've done a lot of battery plants, solar plants. You name it if it's big and needs a lot of dirt moved and infrastructure put in. We do that particular type of project. That market is growing tremendously for us. We see a very strong multi year trend ahead of us, not only with the backlog that we have in place, but the projects we see on the drawing boards and what our customers are telling us. The second segment that we have is around transportation solutions.
This is where the company started back when I joined in 2015. About 95% of our business was in low bid, heavy highway work. That's a very difficult business, very high risk, very low reward. But as you talk about the transformation, today, less than 10% of our business is in low bid heavy highway work. That's why you've seen the margin migration up significantly over the history of that time. We focus set business more on value added type projects in the transportation space, whether that's design build or alternative delivery projects, where instead of just being low cost, we have a value proposition to the end customer at the end of the day that we can design and build the project better and faster in a lot of cases, not necessarily cheaper for the end customer. Also, we've migrated toward aviation and rail. We'll do runways, taxiways, those activities.
Then on the rail side, we have what we call a rapid bridge replacement and some technologies and uses that we can pre-build products, and instead of taking months to replace a damaged bridge or a defunct bridge, we can do that in weeks. As you can imagine, if you're a railroad, they know exactly what an hour of downtime is or a day of downtime that has a high-value proposition for them. Our last segment is in building solutions, and we're in the three fastest-growing, largest markets in the US, which is Dallas, Fort Worth, Houston, and Phoenix. There it's a little different business from the rest in that we do concrete slabs and plumbing for the major builders.
Pulte, Lennar, Horton, are three of our largest customers. We've seen very nice growth in that market over time. If you put that all together, we've built a portfolio of these three segments over the last six or seven years. That's really the beginning point of where we're going in the future. Everybody asks us, you've done such a great job of transforming the business and going from low single digit margins to we have the best margins, the best cash flow, the best returns of anybody in the specialty infrastructure space to where do you go now? This is just the beginning, and that's what's really exciting, what we cannot only add to the three segments that we have today, but we're looking for that fourth leg of the school that has 10-20 years of growth attached to it, as well.
Tom Gardner: One of the pieces of guidance I give to our members in investing is try to align your time arises as investor with the time rise and to the CEO of that company. There are a lot of rapid turnover companies. There are low quality companies everywhere. There are promotional things, and people take companies public after 18 months, just taking advantage of and getting pushed into public markets by VC or private equity. There are a lot of bad and mediocre scenarios.
But if you find a great company, and you should attach your time horizon to the time horizon to that CEO. If you're going to find a great company, that CEO is going to have been at Sterling Infrastructure since 2015, and is going to be talking about, what are the next 10 or 20 years for and thinking about the company in that way, the similar things you'd hear from Jim Sinegal at Costco. Jeff Bezos basically planning 10 years forward at Amazon to the point where they felt that they knew what the earnings report was going to be three years in advance of it at Amazon. I'd love it if you'd speak to our members about going through a period here, short term, where the stock goes 200-120. What you think about, like, obviously, one point on the continuum is, I don't even pay attention. Another is, no, I pay attention, this and that, I get these signals. I'm learning it. But it certainly isn't for a long term CEO a tough moment as to whether or not to stay employed at the business or to continue to stock that you have.
Joe Cutillo: Yeah, it's funny. When we took the big dip, I'll tell you, a lot of friends call and say, Are you, going to jump off a bridge or what's going on, man? Like, for the first couple days, I didn't even watch it. My answer to people is this, I'm not looking at $200 a share. My expectations are much higher than $200 a share. When people ask, Are you worried about getting back to two, I say, No, I'm not worried about getting back to two. I'm worried about getting back to where I want to be or getting to where I want to be. Two isn't in my sights. We'll get there. The market will correct. People will realize we continue to deliver the results. I feel we're going to deliver and the markets are going to do what I believe they're going to do based on what we've seen. We'll get back through that. This is a temporary setback.
I bought it's public knowledge. I bought $1 million of stock last week, I think it was. If it stays down, I'll probably buy some more at some point in time. We're confident in what we know where the company's going, what the markets are giving us right now. I can just tell you, my sites are much higher than $200 a share.
Tom Gardner: What are the impacts now of changing dynamics and regulation, new administration? What are any pluses or minuses for Sterling infrastructure in what seems like a pretty dramatic shift, and, obviously, the tariffs and negotiation and a lot of uncertainty around it. What's the impact on you at least an intermediate-term basis?
Joe Cutillo: Well, I think the perception is there's going to be a lot of impacts. The reality is, and I just talked to some of my friends that are CEOs and similar businesses and other spaces. We've also said the same thing. We just went through COVID, where we were seeing 30% increases in inflation on a monthly, quarterly basis something we have never seen before. If you look at the prices that we were paying for materials and COVID and you look at them now today, if the prices went up 10, 15, 20% because of tariffs, we're still nowhere near what we were fighting from the peak of these material costs. This is like kindergarten compared to what we went through. It's not to say we won't see it. It's not to say you can't see a couple months of pain as you get your contracts updated or you get to the new projects.
But we managed our way through that pretty well. As a matter of fact, much better than I would have thought the world would have managed through it. The reality is, if our material costs go up, we're going to pass it on in pricing. You have that interim of time in some of these contracts before the next phase starts or the next Peace starts, so you might get caught in it. But a lot of our materials first in our transportation, our steel has to be made in America anyways. It's been made in America has to be made in America, all that stuff. People talk about rebar. Well, we do get it from China, but we can get it from Turkey. There's other places we can get it from. It may not go up 25%. It may go up 3% or 4%. What I always worry more about is availability. We can manage inflation and prices. If you don't have products, that becomes very challenging to get stuff built.
We'll get through that. We're all caught a little bit in the tailspin of there's so many things going on, whether it's tariffs or everything else. The market doesn't like uncertainty, and they're trying to figure it out, and sometimes they overthink it, sometimes they underthink it. I just think there's a lot of balls up in the air. We've spent very little time internally worrying about or having to even come up with any planning around the tariff impact on us.
Tom Gardner: It's really interesting thinking this in the context of the concept I really love from the writer Nassim Taleb who wrote a book entitled Antifragile. Essentially the concept of Antifragile not to spoil the whole book. It's a wonderful book is at one end of the continuum, you're fragile. You're a vase that holds flowers. If you're dropped on the ground, you break. You have really only one use. It's a limited function, and it's a fragile. It's risky in its environment. You think the opposite of that is resilient, but resilient isn't the opposite of fragile. Resilient would mean you drop it, and it's fine. It bounces back. It's fine. Antifragile is you thrive on volatility.
Each time a business goes through the complexity of the pandemic, I also think of the writer Peter Drucker, who said, I basically love to find companies that have gone through some hell because they know once that scare me got born into a beautiful environment, everything was rosy for them, flourishing, and then they get hit for the first time. It's quite interesting to hear your context on this because it's obvious hearing you express it, it's obvious that the pandemic was a much greater challenge than the levels of uncertainty right now.
Joe Cutillo: That's what we believe. We actually believe that that if this continues we think there's huge upside for us. All of the whether it's a car manufacturers or pharmaceutical, everything's that's all work for us. We don't care if we're paying $2 a gallon for diesel or $10. The work's still going to get done. Unfortunately, the cost of that project may go up 10%. But we're more worried about that work coming. That's good for us. We're less concerned about the cost of that particular material.

I'm Dylan Lewis, joined again by Asit Sharma and Jason Moser. Jason as we tape, the first round of March Madness is underway. Jason, unfortunately, your beloved Wofford Terriers were in the dance, got bounced by Tennessee in the first round. Did that bust your bracket?
Jason Moser: No, it didn't. Listen, it was a 15 versus a two seed. The odds are telling you something there. Look, Wofford 1,800 plus students. It's a tiny little school. Even when I went there in 95, graduated in 95, it's always been basically that size. Going up against Tennessee is like 40,000 students there. It is a really difficult monumental task to be able to pull that one off. But I tell you, I was really proud watching that game, watching the fight in those guys. They had a difficult year with some injuries and some folks that left. They were able to get it to the Southern Conference Tournament, and then they just got on a heater. The best part about this still little secret here. My wife went to Furman.
You can imagine the back and forth in this household after that game. We always have fun ribbing each other because Furman is a very good team as well. But I was very proud to see that. Just getting to the tournament was a real success, and it reminded me of how grateful I was to be able to watch them beat Seton Hall in the first round. I think it was six years ago. These are just occasions that don't come around all that often. You got to relish them when you get them. Only one team gets to win their last game of the season. That's exactly right. Just being there's fun.
Dylan Lewis: Opposite UNC is up later this afternoon after we tape today. How are you feeling about your tar heels?
Asit Sharma: I'm feeling great win or lose. I really like the way this team has come together with a lineup tweak over the last 10 or 11 games. It's a different team on the ground. I love what happened this past week, Dylan. For those of you who don't know, UNC had a very poor record against so called quad 1 teams, which is one of the criteria that feeds up into the selection committees doling out of bids, and we were the last team into the tournament. It was fun to go from a team which, of course, among Blue Bloods, has its detractors, but to go from that, which is generally beloved team on the college landscape to a revival team, the most revival team in the nation. Was refreshing to pick. It sharpened my tribal instincts. I'm like, these are my people. Blame the committee. Don't blame us.
Jason Moser: The Gaelic really justified that pick, though, as it. They justified that pick with that playing game.
Asit Sharma: Totally, they played a really great play in game. I think Old Miss is a very formidable team, and we have our work cut out for us. I think we're going to squeak by, but I'm happy with whatever happens. You got to finish strong in life.
Dylan Lewis: It sounds, Asit like you and UNC both have a little bit of a chip on your shoulder heading into this tournament.
Asit Sharma: A man. I wake up in the morning I need a reason to compete. I look at my slacks and I see Jamoi has turned out some great research, and I'm like, I'm on it. I'm on my game this morning.
Dylan Lewis: Yeah, competitiveness. It's a core value. Here the Motley Fool. Before we get over to Radar 6, Jason, any investing lessons for people as they're watching the games this weekend?
Jason Moser: Well, I referred back to the size of these two schools, 1,800 versus like 40,000, and it just always takes me back to small caps. Small Caps can be really powerful. You just got to be patient with them. Every once in a while, they'll show up for you and they'll really the world on fire. That's what I associate with this one. Wofford small, but, man, they've got a lot of fight, a lot of strength in them, and I see a lot of growth in their future.
Dylan Lewis: I can hear one shining moment, just playing in the background there. Asit, what about you?
Asit Sharma: Hubert Davis, the coach of UNC, has a great metaphor he uses with his players, which is the blinders that you put on a horse when you're leading it to the race. You take the blinders off. Before the race, right before the race so the horse can just be focused and not be distracted by the outside environment. Sometimes in investing, it really feels like the distractions loom large. The market is down. People are talking down your favorite businesses, and you want to just give up. But those are the great times to just keep the blinders on. What I mean by that is focus on the businesses, not all the noise of the market and share price today. Stay focused on what got you into those businesses in the first place. Their fundamentals and play the game and just be in it for the long term as great teams are. Wofford is a formidable team every year. They have a long term focus, and so does UNC.
Dylan Lewis: Very on theme for Asit to say, Ignore the haters. Do what you got to do. [LAUGHTER] Let's get over to stocks on our Radar. Our man behind the glass, Dan Boyd is going to hit you with a question. Asit, you're up first. What are you looking at this week?
Asit Sharma: I have BYD and this is an electrical vehicle company started in China. My and Jason's great colleague, Emily Flippen had put this in front of my notice. BYD as many people know as a competitor to Tesla and lots of other great EV companies, they are ingenious in their engineering, and they've learned to build a scale up very cheap car. We don't see it here in the US because of import restrictions. But the company's doing really well financially, and it just came out with the announcement that it can charge an electrical vehicle in five minutes, which could be a possible game changer. I'm looking to learn more about this company, and I think anyone who's interested in the EV landscape, this deserves your attention. Take a look.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about BYD, which trades over the counter as BY DDY.
Dan Boyd: We talked about how competitiveness is a core value here at The Motley Fool, and is the competitive atmosphere brought to the table by BYD going to sharpen Tesla, or are they just going to continue to eat Tesla's lunch?
Asit Sharma: I think it's going to sharpen Tesla's focus, and I think sometimes you need a competitor to pull management back into what they set out to do. If you are a shareholder in Tesla and see Elon must be distracted by other things. This is the recipe for your shares to gain to bring him back into sharp focus on his business as BYD continues to succeed.
Dylan Lewis: Jason, what's on your Radar this week?
Jason Moser: There pots and pans every night, Dylan on Williams Sonoma, Ticker WSM remember, this is a retailer with a number of popular brands under its umbrella. It's namesake as well with Pottery Barn, West Elm, and others. A longtime Stock Advisor recommendation has done very well for members. If you look at the five year chart on this thing. It's crazy. Total return almost 900%. Just reported a relatively decent quarter. Comps are up 3.1% gross margin of 130 basis points, operating margin expansion as well. Boosted the quarterly dividend 16% to $0.66 per share. The stock sold off on the report, I think, mostly related to guidance. They just see flat sales and again, some tariff concerns potentially hitting margins here in the coming year.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, a question about William Sonoma. Ticker, WSM.
Dan Boyd: Do you ever buy any of their snacks or candies or anything, Jason, or are you just a pots and pans guy?
Jason Moser: Just a pots and pans guy, Dan, pots and pans.
Dylan Lewis: Dan, pots and pans or EVs? Which way you going this week?
Dan Boyd: I like BYD, but I don't know how to buy them, so I guess by default, it's going to be Williams Sonoma.
Jason Moser: I'll take what I can get.
Dylan Lewis: That feels like a shallow victory. I don't know about that one. Dan, appreciate you weighing in on the Radar 6 this week. Asit, Jason, appreciate you bringing them to us. That's going to do it for this week's Motley Fool Money Radio show. Shows mixed by Dan Boyd. I'm Dylan Lewis. Thanks for listening. We'll see you next time.

In today’s Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market’s pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let’s dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
The SPY is currently trading near our pivot at 574.65. Bulls want immediate momentum above this level, targeting initial resistance at 575.67. Sustained bullish activity above 575.67 could propel SPY upwards to test the support-turned-resistance at 576.62. If the buyers firmly secure this level intraday, a subsequent move towards 577.87 becomes likely, with our ambitious upside target placed at 579.12.
Should SPY lose grip on 574.65 early, bearish sentiment would dominate, first challenging 573.50. Persistent selling below this point would open up potential downside to 572.15. Breaking beneath 572.15 would accelerate selling momentum, aiming next at strong support located at 571.06. A severe bearish breakdown would set the stage for a test of our ultimate daily bearish target at 569.98.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
The QQQ is actively trading around our critical zone of 490.05. The bullish scenario hinges on price stability above this level, with an initial push toward reclaiming support at 491.82. A strong bid could then carry price action to 493.60. Should the market see sustained buying, QQQ would target resistance at 495.35, aiming higher still toward our premium bull target at 496.94.
If bullish momentum falters at 490.05, bears would step in decisively, initially pressing the price lower towards 487.69. Further weakness could expose the next significant support at 486.10. Continuous selling pressure might push QQQ to retest critical support at 483.95. Failure to hold here under aggressive bearish sentiment would guide the market down to our bearish objective at 481.73.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple shares currently hover near our pivot point of 220.29. Bullish participants need to assert control here, pushing price upwards initially to 220.97. Sustained bullish enthusiasm could propel AAPL towards a key upside target at 221.66. Should buying persist throughout the session, the bulls will aim for today’s high-end target of 222.24.
Conversely, failure to maintain 220.29 as support would activate bearish sellers targeting the initial downside at 219.19. Increased selling activity below this level would set the stage for a move lower towards 218.08. Continued bearish momentum could then pressure Apple shares towards 216.70, and an aggressive selling scenario would target the daily low-end bearish objective at 215.25.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft is trading around our primary support zone at 394.46. Bulls are looking for clear strength above this level, initially targeting a rally to secure 395.68 as intraday support. If buyers successfully stabilize price action above 395.68, MSFT could extend its rally towards the higher resistance at 397.65. Continued bullish conviction could ultimately lead to reaching our premium bull target for Microsoft today at 398.38.
Should 394.46 fail to hold, bearish traders would quickly target a downside move towards 393.47. Further weakness below this point would bring a test of 392.49 into focus. If selling pressure intensifies, bears will attempt to force MSFT lower toward critical support at 390.98. Under a strong bearish impulse, our low bear target for Microsoft today is positioned at 389.29.
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
NVIDIA currently trades near the pivotal area of 120.27. Bullish momentum here requires a firm rally towards 121.97, reclaiming it as a firm intraday support. Continued strength on the buy-side could elevate price action up to 123.41, with potential bullish extension towards 125.21. If buyers dominate the session, we anticipate reaching the day’s optimistic bullish target at 126.84.
If NVDA struggles and breaches below the critical 120.27 level, bearish traders will target the immediate downside at 119.44. Continued weakness from this point would encourage sellers to challenge 117.86. Persistent bearish sentiment would likely push price action towards 116.61, and an aggressive sell-off could result in reaching today’s bearish extreme at 115.83.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is presently trading near our key reference point at 167.04. Bullish control here demands maintaining support at this level and driving prices initially upwards towards 169.34. Persistent bullish sentiment throughout the session could then accelerate GOOGL toward today’s optimistic bullish target of 171.14.
However, should 167.04 fail to hold, bearish traders would swiftly capitalize, pressuring the price down to initial support at 165.41. If this area collapses under heavy selling, the next downside target would be 163.79. Sustained bearish pressure might result in an extended sell-off, ultimately targeting the day’s low-end bearish goal of 161.79.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta shares are trading near our critical support at 622.01. Bulls must secure this level to prompt an upward push towards initial resistance at 629.88. Persistent bullish pressure could then push META higher towards the intermediate resistance of 635.49. Strong buying activity throughout today’s session could ultimately target the aggressive bullish daily level at 642.59.
If 622.01 fails under bearish attack, sellers would quickly aim for an initial downside move towards 615.65. Increased bearish intensity would expose further downside towards 609.30. Continued selling below this level would place bearish traders in firm control, targeting the day’s bearish extremity at 604.50.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is trading around our pivotal mark at 281.32. Bullish activity above this zone would see buyers initially aiming higher at 283.95. Continued strength could drive the price action towards an important intraday level at 286.34. If broader market conditions favor bulls, TSLA would likely attempt a move towards stronger resistance at 288.80, ultimately reaching our ambitious bullish daily target at 290.47.
A breakdown below 281.32 would immediately shift control to bearish traders, targeting the initial support test at 279.43. If selling continues below this area, further downside pressure would extend toward 278.11. Breaking through this key support level under heightened bearish momentum would accelerate a decline towards today’s bearish limit at 275.07.

What Happened: Cramer attributed the market rebound to the potential for a more transparent future in global trade. He suggested that the crucial element was the prospect of a plan that would allow foreign nations or companies to offset tariffs, as per a CNBC report. “It’s a path, and once you get a path, you get possible transparency and certainty. And that’s what stock markets like,” Cramer explained.
Despite caution over President Donald Trump‘s tariff plans, investors were hopeful. The President’s hints at potential tariff breaks for “a lot of countries” added to the positive sentiment.
While Cramer didn’t rule out the possibility of Trump reverting to stricter tariff policies, he suggested that the President may have considered the market’s reaction when it entered a correction phase a few weeks ago. Major companies, including Stargate, Apple Inc. AAPL, Taiwan Semiconductor TSM, and Hyundai, are beginning to commit to manufacturing in the U.S., adding to the upbeat sentiment.
""Those are wins. Big wins,"" stated Cramer. ""There's now a paradigm that companies can follow if they want to have access to our markets.""

Why It Matters: The market rally on Monday was influenced by President Trump’s softer tone on potential tariffs ahead of the April 2, 2025 deadline, easing trade tension concerns. Additionally, strong economic data, including a significant rebound in services activity in March, helped alleviate recession fears.
Furthermore, the tech sector, particularly the “Mag Seven” stocks, could face a significant impact from the new tariffs set to take effect on April 2, as noted by Gene Munster, managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management. This date, dubbed the ‘Vortex Day’ by Munster, is also significant as it coincides with the release of Tesla’s delivery numbers, which are expected to be weaker than anticipated.
On Monday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased by 1.42%, the S&P 500 SPY rose 1.76%, and the Nasdaq Composite QQQ grew 2.27%.

INTC is reportedly strategizing to rejuvenate its chip design and broaden its foundry business, with the potential of securing significant clients such as Nvidia Corp. NVDA and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.
What Happened: UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri believes Intel’s new CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, will prioritize the company’s design and foundry capabilities in the immediate plan. Arcuri further stated that Intel is on the verge of securing commitments from Nvidia or Broadcom to utilize its foundry services, while also progressing its 18A manufacturing process, reported Seeking Alpha.
Arcuri stated that Nvidia seems more likely than Broadcom to adopt Intel’s foundry technology, possibly for gaming applications, though power consumption remains a significant concern. 
Intel is also said to be planning to compete more aggressively with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. TSM enhancing its packaging innovations. The company’s partnership with United Microelectronics Corp. UMC is progressing well, with production expected to start in late 2026. This could establish them as a secondary high-voltage FinFET supplier after TSMC and potentially lead to future collaborations with Apple AAPL.
Arcuri stated that further details on Intel’s foundry developments will be revealed at the upcoming Direct Connect event on April 29.

Why It Matters: The strategic shift comes in the wake of a leadership change at Intel. The company’s stock rallied following the announcement of its new CEO, with shares increasing by approximately 25%. In his first statement after being chosen as the new CEO, Tan pointed towards an overhaul plan including cost-cutting measures, a restructuring of management and a renewed focus on AI chip production. 
He has openly criticized former CEO Pat Gelsinger's approach, especially in manufacturing and decision-making. One of Tan's main priorities is overhauling Intel Foundry, which supplies chips to companies like Microsoft and Amazon. He is also expected to revive AI initiatives beyond servers, focusing on software, robotics, and AI foundation models.
Meanwhile, the new Intel CEO is all set to deliver an opening keynote at Intel Vision 2025 on March 31 in Las Vegas wherein he is scheduled to address how the company aims to empower innovative solutions and accelerate business success in the AI era.
Intel stock climbed 5.35% over the past month. It closed 0.16% lower on Monday at $24.22.
Intel holds a momentum rating of 27.89% and a growth rating of 3.76%, according to Benzinga's Proprietary Edge Rankings.

Key Points
Despite an increasingly sprawling portfolio, Buffett still likes to bet big on his best ideas.
Warren Buffett would probably say Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A 0.06%) (BRK.B 0.02%) portfolio is highly diversified. It currently owns 44 different publicly traded stocks. On top of that, it owns dozens of private companies and nonmarketable securities. That's an absolutely sprawling portfolio for someone who once said, ""If you know how to analyze businesses and value businesses, it's crazy to own 50 stocks, or 40 stocks, or 30 stocks probably.""
To be sure, Berkshire Hathaway is a much different company than when Buffett said that at Berkshire's 1996 shareholder meeting. Its sheer size requires it to take advantage of opportunities wherever Buffett and his team of investment managers can find them, regardless of how big or small. And those opportunities are increasingly few and far between. But Berkshire's publicly traded equity portfolio still shows that Buffett abides by another key principle Buffett espoused at that shareholder meeting: ""We like to put a lot of money into things we feel strongly about.""
Of the $283 billion Berkshire Hathaway holds in publicly traded equities, a whopping 47% of that is concentrated in just three stocks.
Image source: The Motley Fool.
Despite selling over two-thirds of Berkshire's stake in Apple (AAPL 1.18%) since late 2023, the stock still remains its top equity holding by a significant margin. That's thanks in part to its strong performance over the last two years. But even more thanks goes to the incredible price performance since Buffett first established a position in the stock in 2016. The share price has increased roughly tenfold in that time.
When Berkshire first bought shares of Apple, the stock was trading at an incredible valuation, around 10 times earnings. Considering the iPhone and iPad were already runaway hits at that point, producing billions in free cash flow, it's no wonder Buffett decided to pour $36 billion into the stock over the next couple of years.
Apple has continued to produce significant earnings and free cash flow growth since Berkshire initially acquired shares. It's found success with new products like Apple Watch and AirPods, and its services segment has transformed into a high-margin growth engine. That segment should continue to grow over the next few years, especially as Apple incorporates more artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities into the iPhone.
However, roughly two-thirds of Apple's stock price appreciation since 2016 came from multiple expansion, not earnings growth. The stock now trades around 30 times forward earnings. Based on Buffett's decision to sell the majority of Berkshire's stake in the stock over the past year, it suggests he thinks that's very pricey for the shares.
But Apple's massive capital return program ensures shareholders receive a growing portion of earnings every year, which helps justify a significant premium to the overall market. While Buffett might prefer a better price for the shares, he still believes strongly enough in the company to maintain a significant portion of Berkshire's portfolio in the stock.
American Express (AXP -1.27%) is one of the longest-held stocks in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, and Buffett has suggested he has no plans to sell the shares. Berkshire paid $1.3 billion for its position in Amex stock in the mid-'90s. Those shares are worth about $40.5 billion as of this writing. All the while, it's paid out a considerable dividend to shareholders. In fact, Berkshire will collect about $500 million in dividends from Amex over the next year.
American Express is unique in its position as a credit card company. It both issues credit cards and operates the payment network they run on. Typically, banks partner with a payment network, but Amex's position allows it to keep a greater share of the economics of each card transaction. As a result, it historically hasn't relied as much on collecting interest on consumer debt for its revenue compared to bank-issued credit cards.
Over time, however, Amex has built a portfolio of credit products that appeal to a wide range of consumers and businesses, but mostly focused on high-income households. That includes accounts charging interest, which is a growing portion of revenue. Interest income increased 18% last year, accounting for roughly a quarter of total revenue. Another fast-growing portion of the business are annual fees it charges on its cards. Its premium products have found broad appeal, especially with younger consumers, suggesting a long runway of continued growth for Amex ahead.
Shares of American Express trade for less than 18 times forward earnings as of this writing. With a focus on more affluent consumers, Amex's growth engines of higher fees and increasing its loans can continue to drive results without as much downside risk as credit issuers focus more on lower-income households. As a result, it should be able to produce more steady earnings growth over the long run, making it a great value at this price.
Another stock that's gotten the axe from Buffett recently is Bank of America (BAC -0.47%), a company in which he first invested in 2011. Berkshire provided $5 billion in capital to the bank in exchange for preferred stock paying a 6% annual dividend and warrants for 700 million shares of the common stock.
When Bank of America raised the dividend on its common stock in 2017, it became more profitable to own those shares instead of the preferred shares, and Buffett exercised Berkshire's warrants. He continued to add to Berkshire's position through 2020.
Bank of America has bounced back strong from the depths of the financial crisis, and that momentum has increased in recent years. The company opened hundreds of new financial centers over the last few years, which helped it add 213,000 net new consumer checking accounts last quarter, marking six consecutive years of quarterly growth. It's also seeing strong growth in commercial and investment banking, credit card issuing, and wealth management. Every source of revenue increased for Bank of America last quarter.
The biggest drag on Bank of America's results over the last two years has been the rise in interest rates. The bank holds longer-dated securities than most of its competitors. As a result, when interest rates climbed in 2022 and 2023, Bank of America eventually saw its net interest income start declining. However, it's now set up to outperform going forward as interest rates come back down, and its net interest income is quickly approaching its previous peak.
Bank of America's progress over the last year has not gone unnoticed. The stock is up more than 50% from this time in 2023. That's led it to extend its valuation to nearly 1.6 times its tangible book value. Buffett sold shares in the third and fourth quarter last year, when its valuation looked even loftier. But at 1.6 times book value, it's not a bad price to pay for a company with the strength and momentum of Bank of America right now.

Key Points
The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC -0.41%) has spent much of March more than 10% off its all-time high, which put the index in correction territory. But Wall Street analysts see that drawdown an opportunity to buy shares of Arm Holdings (ARM -2.71%) and Upstart Holdings (UPST -6.68%).
Here's what investors should know about Arm and Upstart.
Arm designs CPUs and subsystems that let clients develop custom chips for end markets like mobile devices and data centers. Arm does not sell chips directly (at least not yet), but rather licenses intellectual property to other companies. Arm also provides software development tools that help engineers write and debug applications on its processors.
Every CPU has an architecture, an instruction set that defines how the hardware interacts with software. Arm architectures have traditionally been associated with power efficiency, while x86 architectures from Intel and AMD have traditionally been associated with compute performance. Consequently, Arm chips are the logical choice in battery-powered devices. It has more than 99% market share in smartphones and 67% market share in other mobile devices.
Likewise, Intel and AMD chips have long been the industry standard in personal computers and data center servers. But Arm is gaining market share in those categories because of performance improvements and the flexibility its business model affords customers. Apple has transitioned its MacBooks to Arm chips, and the three largest public clouds -- Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet -- have designed Arm-based data center processors for artificial intelligence and general purpose workloads.
Arm gave a strong performance in the third quarter fiscal 2025, which ended in December 2024. Revenue increased 19% to $983 million as AI drove demand for more energy efficient computing platforms, and non-GAAP net income increased 26% to $0.39 per diluted share. But shares declined following the report because Arm narrowed its full-year guidance, such that revenue and net income are forecast to increase 23% and 26%, respectively.
Wall Street estimates Arm's adjusted earnings will increase at 31% annually through fiscal 2026, which ends in March 2026. That makes the current valuation around 85 times adjusted earnings look somewhat expensive. So, I am skeptical about the stock advancing 42% in the next year, but patient investors can consider buying a small position today.
Upstart uses AI to make lending more profitable. Over 100 banks and credit unions use its platform to provide consumer credit products, including personal and automotive loans, refinancing, and home equity lines of credit. Whereas most lenders make credit decisions with simple rules-based systems that consider a small number of variables, Upstart's machine learning models consider thousands of variables.
Consequently, the company says its credit decisioning technology is more accurate than traditional lending models. Banks using its platform can not only approve more applicants, but also offer lower interest rates to those borrowers. Additionally, most loans originated on its platform are fully automated, which improves operational efficiency for the lender.
Upstart reported fourth-quarter financial results that beat estimates on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 56% to $219 million as loan origination volume soared, and non-GAAP net income improved to $0.29 per diluted share, up from a loss of $0.11 per diluted share in the same period last year. The company anticipates 56% revenue growth in 2025.
Upstart estimates its total addressable market at more than $2 trillion in loan originations. But transaction volume on its AI-powered lending platform was less than $6 billion in 2024, which means the company has hardly scratched the surface of its market opportunity.
With that in mind, the stock currently trades at 7.8 times sales, a discount to the historical average of 9 times sales. That price is not exactly cheap, but investors with a time horizon of at least three years should consider buying a small position today. I am skeptical about Upstart returning 57% in the next year, though it could happen under the right conditions.
As a caveat, Upstart is very sensitive to the macroeconomic climate. Banks usually charge higher interest rates as inflation increases, which diminishes consumer demand for credit. Therefore, any reacceleration in inflation would likely be bad news for Upstart, at least temporarily. Indeed, the stock is currently 86% below its high, and it was rising inflation and interest rates post-COVID that sent shares falling in the first place.
