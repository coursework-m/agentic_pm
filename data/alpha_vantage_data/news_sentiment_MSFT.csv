He recently posted a viral clip on X featuring Unitree‚Äôs G1 robot performing combat-style kicks and Tai Chi moves, describing it as part of a massive shift in how work will get done.
Deepseek is AI that costs pennies.Unitree is Robots that cost less than a MacBook. DeepSeek + Unitree G1 = the future of cheap, scalable digital labor.  It's not science fiction anymore. ‚ù§Ô∏èü§ñ pic.twitter.com/P6YHRTMcDL
Don't Miss:
‚ÄúDeepSeek is AI that costs pennies. Unitree is robots that cost less than a MacBook,‚Äù Benioff wrote, claiming that combining the two equals ‚Äúthe future of cheap, scalable digital labor.‚Äù But readers were quick to point out that the Unitree G1 actually starts at $16,000, which is significantly more than the price of a MacBook.
Benioff isn't just hyping up viral robot videos. He's actively steering Salesforce toward a future dominated by autonomous AI agents. Through the company's Agentforce platform, Salesforce plans to deploy 1 billion AI agents within a year. These digital workers are designed to handle tasks across departments like sales, service, and marketing without human input.
‚ÄúWe are not at that moment we've seen in those crazy movies‚Äîand maybe we will be one day‚Äîbut that is not where we are today,‚Äù Benioff said on a recent Wall Street Journal podcast. He added that tools like ChatGPT get too much attention, and that the real breakthrough lies in agents that can take independent action.
Trending: Hasbro, MGM, and Skechers trust this AI marketing firm ‚Äî invest pre-IPO from $0.55 per share now.
Benioff also shared how a virtual tour guide at a Disney park used AI to customize his itinerary based on ride history and park conditions. For him, that's a glimpse of how AI can reshape not just the office, but everyday life.
Salesforce is moving beyond customer relationship management software and into what Benioff calls the ""digital labor revolution."" He estimates the market could be worth as much as $12 trillion. ‚ÄúThis is much bigger than software,‚Äù he said during Salesforce's latest earnings call. The company is banking on its deeply integrated platform‚Äîcombining Agentforce, Customer 360, and Data Cloud‚Äîto lead the charge.
Despite a mixed quarterly report, where Salesforce beat earnings estimates but narrowly missed on revenue, Benioff's long-term outlook remains bullish. CNBC's Jim Cramer even called Agentforce ‚Äúpretty revolutionary,‚Äù linking the product's potential to Salesforce's 33% stock rally in 2025.

Unitree's G1 robot is making headlines for more than its martial arts skills. It's part of a new wave of humanoid machines trained using virtual simulations. The G1 learns in Nvidia's Isaac Simulator and uses a method called Sim2Real to apply those virtual skills in the real world. The robot has 23 degrees of freedom, a foldable frame, and high-end sensors including 3D LiDAR and a depth camera.
Standing 4.3 feet tall and weighing 77 pounds, the G1 can walk, balance, flip, and even react to being kicked‚Äîall powered by an 8-core CPU and a swappable battery. Unitree has also made its motion data open source to encourage further development of human-like movement in robots.
While the price tag doesn't quite match Benioff's MacBook comparison, the technology is getting cheaper, faster, and more capable. And with big players like Salesforce, Microsoft MSFT, Nvidia NVDA and OpenAI all embracing digital agents, the workforce of the future may look very different‚Äîand much more robotic.

MSFT,Assessing Microsoft's Performance Against Competitors In Software Industry - Microsoft  ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) ,20250327,Somewhat-bullish,0.288816,"In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business world, it is crucial for investors and industry followers to conduct comprehensive company evaluations. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft MSFT in relation to its major competitors in the ...",Benzinga,www.benzinga.com,https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/25/03/44516781/assessing-microsofts-performance-against-competitors-in-software-industry,"In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business world, it is crucial for investors and industry followers to conduct comprehensive company evaluations. In this article, we will delve into an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft MSFT in relation to its major competitors in the Software industry. By closely examining key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and highlight company's performance in the industry.
Microsoft develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. It is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. The company is organized into three equally sized broad segments: productivity and business processes (legacy Microsoft Office, cloud-based Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, LinkedIn, Dynamics), intelligence cloud (infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings Azure, Windows Server OS, SQL Server), and more personal computing (Windows Client, Xbox, Bing search, display advertising, and Surface laptops, tablets, and desktops).
After examining Microsoft, the following trends can be inferred: 
With a Price to Earnings ratio of 31.42, which is 0.4x less than the industry average, the stock shows potential for growth at a reasonable price, making it an interesting consideration for market participants.
With a Price to Book ratio of 9.58, significantly falling below the industry average by 0.41x, it suggests undervaluation and the possibility of untapped growth prospects.
The stock's relatively high Price to Sales ratio of 11.13, surpassing the industry average by 1.4x, may indicate an aspect of overvaluation in terms of sales performance.
With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.17% that is 0.76% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.
The company has higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $36.79 Billion, which is 56.6x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.
The company has higher gross profit of $47.83 Billion, which indicates 35.17x above the industry average, indicating stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.
The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 12.27% compared to the industry average of 12.5%, which indicates a challenging sales environment.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio measures the financial leverage of a company by evaluating its debt relative to its equity.
Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
When examining Microsoft in comparison to its top 4 peers with respect to the Debt-to-Equity ratio, the following information becomes apparent:
Microsoft is in a relatively stronger financial position compared to its top 4 peers, as evidenced by its lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.21.
This implies that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity.
For Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE and PB ratios suggest the stock is undervalued compared to peers, indicating potential for growth. However, the high PS ratio implies the stock may be overvalued based on revenue. In terms of ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit, Microsoft outperforms peers, reflecting strong profitability and operational efficiency. The low revenue growth rate may indicate a need for strategic initiatives to drive top-line performance in the future.

In February, the analysts highlighted leases Microsoft had abandoned in the US. They described the latest move as the company‚Äôs choice to forgo some new business from ChatGPT maker OpenAI.
Microsoft and OpenAI this year restructured a multiyear deal, letting OpenAI use cloud-computing services from other companies, provided Microsoft did not want the business itself.

The TD Cowen analysts said in a note that Microsoft‚Äôs retrenchment in the last six months included lease cancellations and deferrals.¬†
According to Reuters, TD Cowen said in the note that its supply chain checks indicated that Microsoft‚Äôs pullback has led to Alphabet Inc.‚Äôs GOOG GOOGL Google to backfill the capacity in international markets. At the same time, Meta Platforms Inc. META had scooped up some of the freed capacity in Europe.
Microsoft says it remains on track to spend about $80 billion building AI data centers this fiscal year.
Chinese upstart DeepSeeks‚Äôs open-source AI model led to Wall Street questioning the sustainability of Microsoft, Meta, and¬†Amazon.com Inc.‚Äôs¬†AMZN¬†capex outlays on AI models.
Goldman Sachs analyst Kash Rangan noted Microsoft as one of the best investment opportunities in the technology sector, citing its¬†investments in the AI sector.
The analyst highlighted Microsoft‚Äôs AI investments, which are spread out across hardware and geography, signifying its long-term focus on the growing technology. Microsoft‚Äôs 365 and Azure are just two products that could grow in coming quarters, he added.
Price Action:¬†MSFT stock was around flat at $390.01 at the last check Thursday.

Launched in October 2024, XMAG has quickly emerged as a game-changing tool for investors seeking to diversify and manage concentration risk in a market rattled by the Mag 7 crash.
Unlike traditional S&P 500 funds, XMAG tracks the BITA US 500 ex-Magnificent 7 Index, offering exposure to the largest 500 U.S. equities while deliberately excluding the Mag 7. This strategic design has paid off handsomely this year, delivering robust returns and stability at a time when overexposure to these tech titans has dragged down broader market performance. As the S&P 500 struggles under the weight of the Mag 7's decline, XMAG stands out as a core replacement for large-cap exposure‚Äîa direct, smarter alternative to the S&P 500.
""Investors and advisors have long been overexposed to the Magnificent 7 through mutual funds, ETFs, and individual stock portfolios,"" said Sylvia Jablonski, CEO and CIO of Defiance ETFs. ""This year's market dynamics have exposed the risks of that concentration, and XMAG has proven its worth as a powerful solution. It's not just about dodging the Mag 7 crash‚Äîit's about delivering diversified, resilient returns that redefine large-cap investing.""
With the Mag 7's dominance waning, XMAG offers a timely and effective way to rebalance portfolios, reduce risk, and capture the strength of the broader U.S. equity market. Its performance in 2025 underscores its role as an essential tool for advisors and investors looking to pivot away from tech-heavy strategies and embrace a more balanced approach to growth.
""XMAG isn't a niche play‚Äîit's a core holding,"" Jablonski added. ""It's the diversification investors have been craving, and the results speak for themselves. As the market evolves, XMAG is setting a new standard for large-cap exposure.""

In today‚Äôs Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market‚Äôs pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let‚Äôs dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
Bulls currently have SPY trading near the critical pivot of 567.81. For a bullish scenario, a decisive move higher through 569.16 is crucial. Sustained buying above 569.98 could provide enough strength to target a rally towards 571.06. If buyers successfully defend this mark, expect continuation to the upside targeting 572.15, with an ambitious upside goal of 573.50.¬†
If SPY struggles and fails to maintain support at 567.81, bearish momentum would likely emerge, pushing prices down initially toward 566.46. Persistent selling pressure at this level could open the path to lower support zones at 565.38, followed by a critical test at 564.29. A heavy sell-off scenario today may extend prices down to our bearish objective at 563.23.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
QQQ is currently trading near the pivotal 481.73 level. For the bullish narrative to unfold, buyers must clearly establish dominance above this mark, followed by a firm move toward 483.95. Continued positive momentum should support an advance toward 486.10, potentially driving prices higher to test 487.69. If the bullish scenario plays out robustly, the day‚Äôs bullish target stands at 490.05.¬†
However, if buyers cannot maintain strength at 481.73, bears will likely seize control and press downward to test support at 479.03. Increasing bearish sentiment would likely prompt further selling toward 476.85, with subsequent downside continuation to a key support zone at 474.66. Should selling intensity increase, a drop towards our bearish goal at 471.33 becomes probable.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is trading near the key reference point of 220.29. For bullish traders, securing support above this mark is essential, potentially driving price action toward 220.97. Persistent upward momentum may fuel further bullish expansion toward 221.66, ultimately challenging the higher resistance area marked at our bullish target of 222.24.¬†
Conversely, failure to defend the level of 220.29 may activate bearish sentiment, prompting an initial sell-off toward 219.19. If bearish momentum accelerates, anticipate a deeper decline to support around 218.08, and further selling could extend the downside pressure to test 216.70. A sustained bearish environment may ultimately guide the price to our bearish objective at 215.25.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft's current price action revolves closely around our benchmark at 389.29. For bullish sentiment to remain intact, bulls must decisively defend this area and push upward toward the next resistance level of 390.98. Holding this level through regular trading hours could stimulate additional upward movement toward 392.49, and continued bullish activity may reach our primary bullish target of 393.47.¬†
If bulls fail to support price at 389.29, bearish traders could aggressively target initial downside at 388.53. Should this support fail, expect additional bearish momentum driving prices lower towards 387.60, and potentially extending further downward to 386.09. Under persistent selling pressure, the day‚Äôs bearish target for Microsoft is set at 385.42.
NVIDIA Corporation NVDA
NVIDIA is actively trading near our significant pivot at 111.70. Bullish participants will need to convincingly push through initial resistance at 112.54, firmly establishing support there to encourage upside continuation toward 113.68. Increased bullish strength may support a rally up to 114.29, with a bullish scenario setting sights on the primary bullish objective of 115.15.¬†
On the flip side, a breakdown below the key support level of 111.70 would open the possibility of bearish acceleration toward 110.73. A continuation of selling pressure could drive prices down further, testing 109.86. Additional weakness may prompt bears to push the auction even lower towards 109.12, with today‚Äôs bearish target resting at 107.51.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is trading closely near our significant pivot of 165.41. Bulls must defend this area effectively, enabling upward momentum toward initial resistance at 167.04. Continued bullish sentiment could propel prices further upwards, aiming at our primary bullish target today set at 169.34.¬†
Alternatively, a failure to hold support at 165.41 could initiate bearish activity pushing prices down towards the next key support level at 163.79. If bearish pressure remains intense, expect further decline toward 161.79. Sustained downside momentum could ultimately guide price toward our bearish objective today at 160.36.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is currently trading near the pivotal level of 604.50. Bulls will look to sustain support above this critical area, setting the stage for an initial bullish test at 609.30. Continued buying could further energize the auction towards 615.65, with a robust bullish environment potentially reaching our high bullish target today of 622.01.¬†
Should support at 604.50 fail during today‚Äôs session, bearish traders will likely drive prices downward toward the next key area at 598.17. If bearish sentiment intensifies, look for additional declines reaching 591.29. A deeper breakdown could eventually lead Meta's price action toward the bearish target today at 585.73.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is presently trading close to our essential reference point at 275.07. Bulls will aim for decisive upward momentum targeting initial resistance at 278.11. Sustained bullish sentiment could carry prices higher toward our next key level at 279.43, potentially advancing further toward 281.32. If buyer interest is particularly robust today, the ultimate bullish objective is established at 283.95.¬†
Conversely, should the 275.07 support level fail, anticipate immediate bearish pressure toward 272.42. Continued selling intensity could further pressure prices downwards, testing lower at 269.48. If bearish momentum deepens significantly, a further decline toward today's bearish target of 266.83 is likely.
Final Word:
Today‚Äôs trading environment is heavily influenced by key economic data, beginning with Initial and Continuing Jobless Claims at 8:30 AM ET, released concurrently with Advance Goods Trade Balance and Retail Inventories for February, along with the significant Q4 GDP Annualized Price Index (Third Reading). Later at 10 AM ET, Pending Home Sales data for February arrives, providing additional market-moving potential. Additionally, watch for the Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Activity Index for March at 11:00 AM ET, followed by a crucial 7-Year Treasury Note Auction at 1 PM ET.¬†
Given the breadth and significance of today's economic releases, heightened volatility is anticipated across markets. Traders should approach today‚Äôs session prepared, emphasizing risk management and strategic patience, as data-driven price action could lead to considerable swings. Stay disciplined, and trade safe!

Key Points
While Wall Street analysts project a healthy 10% total return for the S&P 500 in 2025, reality has painted a different picture. Nearly three months into the year, the benchmark index has retreated 1.6% at the time of this writing, leaving many investors questioning their domestic market exposure.
This pullback stems largely from market jitters surrounding President Donald Trump's shift toward protectionist trade policies and his administration's aggressive approach to reducing government expenditures. In response, cautious investors have begun rotating into international markets, fixed-income securities, precious metals, and cash positions.

Though these defensive moves might seem prudent amid short-term uncertainty, they risk missing what could be a generational opportunity. Despite today's economic headwinds, three powerful technological forces are converging to potentially usher in an unprecedented era of American prosperity.
Below, I talk about three compelling reasons why investors fleeing U.S. equities today may be making a critical mistake. Those who maintain or increase their exposure through index-based exchange-traded funds (ETFs) like the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO -0.21%) could be positioning themselves at the ground floor of what might truly become America's new golden age.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers investors exceptional exposure to the coming artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Nearly a third of its portfolio consists of tech leaders like Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, companies at the forefront of developing and deploying these transformative technologies.
This positioning matters because AI represents perhaps the most significant economic catalyst of our time. Goldman Sachs projects AI will boost global GDP by $7 trillion, a 7% increase over the next decade. McKinsey & Co.'s estimates are even more bullish, suggesting AI could generate between $17 trillion and $26 trillion annually. Moreover, many analysts consider these rather bullish economic projections conservative.
According to the International Monetary Fund, AI will affect almost 40% of jobs worldwide, fundamentally reshaping how work gets done and dramatically boosting productivity across sectors. This massive workforce transformation represents just the beginning of AI's economic impact.
Unlike narrow sector funds that might capture only specific segments of the AI value chain, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF -- a fund managed by Vanguard that invests in the stocks in the S&P 500 index, which represent the 500 largest publicly traded companies in the U.S. -- offers exposure to the entire ecosystem, from semiconductor manufacturers powering AI development to software giants implementing solutions to businesses across every sector benefiting from productivity gains.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides strategic exposure to companies harnessing advanced robotics capabilities, positioning investors to benefit from what may become the most significant industrial transformation since the assembly line.
Recent breakthroughs have dramatically accelerated robotic development. According to Oxford Economics, robotic adoption has surpassed earlier forecasts, particularly in manufacturing powerhouses like China and South Korea. Their research projects that 20 million manufacturing jobs could be displaced by 2030, representing not just cost savings but massive productivity improvements across industrial sectors.
What's changed? The robotics landscape has fundamentally transformed through AI integration with mechanical systems. Carnegie Mellon University researchers have created quadruped robots performing extreme parkour -- parkour is basically jumping between things -- and navigating complex environments without traditional programming constraints. 
Concurrently, scientists at Toyota Research Institute have trained robots to master hundreds of practical skills through human demonstration techniques, dramatically accelerating deployment timelines for industrial and service applications.
This robotics revolution isn't limited to manufacturing. Service sector adoption is also accelerating, with robots increasingly visible in logistics, healthcare, and customer service. Companies throughout the S&P 500 index stand to benefit both as developers and implementers of these productivity-enhancing technologies.
For investors seeking exposure to this transformation, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF offers broad participation across the entire robotics ecosystem, from component manufacturers to software developers to businesses implementing these technologies to gain competitive advantage.
Quantum computing represents the third technological pillar supporting an emerging golden age for America. This revolutionary computing paradigm is moving rapidly from theoretical research to practical commercial applications across key industries.
McKinsey & Co. projects that quantum technologies could add $2 trillion in value over the next decade, with benefits concentrated in four industries: chemicals, finance, life sciences, and transportation. What's particularly compelling for S&P 500 investors is the timeline; major management consultancies anticipate that businesses could begin reaping profits from quantum technologies as soon as this year.
Real-world applications are already emerging. Mercedes-Benz has been working with International Business Machines to leverage quantum computing for developing more efficient batteries. In financial services, Goldman Sachs expects that quantum capabilities will enable more accurate market modeling and risk assessment. Pharmaceutical companies throughout the index are positioned to accelerate drug development by rapidly simulating molecular interactions.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides balanced exposure to both quantum technology developers and the diverse industries positioned to benefit from early adoption. While targeted technology funds might capture direct quantum computing players, the S&P 500's broad composition offers a unique advantage: exposure to the entire quantum ecosystem, from computational infrastructure to practical applications across multiple sectors.
The convergence of AI, advanced robotics, and quantum computing represents an unprecedented technological inflection point. While market volatility tied to policy shifts has created short-term uncertainty, these three powerful catalysts are laying the foundation for what could become America's most productive economic era.
The Vanguard S&P 500 ETF provides investors with balanced exposure to all three trends.
Perhaps most compelling for long-term investors is the fund's minuscule expense ratio of just 0.03%, ensuring that virtually all of the market's returns flow directly to shareholders rather than being consumed by management fees. This cost efficiency becomes increasingly meaningful when compounded over decades of potential growth.
The bottom line? While others retreat to the sidelines, forward-thinking investors can position themselves for America's technological renaissance through what may be the market's most efficient vehicle: the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF.

Key Points
Some investors are looking closely at the stocks they own and asking themselves if they could weather an economic slowdown. U.S. President Donald Trump's threats of tariffs against trading partners and recent comments by the Federal Reserve about uncertainty in the economy are sparking fears.
Amazon (AMZN 0.41%) investors aren't immune from the concerns. Amazon's stock has tumbled 8% since the beginning of the year. But is the sell-off an overreaction?
Let's consider some of the hurdles Amazon could face over the next 12 months, as well as some likely ways the company may continue growing.
Image source: Getty Images.
Some economists are concerned that President Trump's potential willingness to start trade wars could eventually tip the U.S. into a recession. J.P. Morgan recently changed its prediction on the probability of a recession occurring this year, from 30% likelihood to 40% currently.
Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell recently added some fuel to the recession fears fire when he said that economic ""uncertainty is remarkably high."" Consumer spending fell for the first time in nearly two years in January, indicating that Americans are pulling back on purchases.
Amazon's largest business by revenue is its North American e-commerce sales. That segment brought in $115.6 billion in sales in the fourth quarter, a 10% increase from the year-ago quarter. But consumer spending is moderating and consumer confidence is weakening, according to the Fed. If a full-blown recession or even a slowdown occurs, it could result in Americans tightening their belts further.
While there are legitimate concerns about consumer spending slowing this year, there's no guarantee it'll affect Amazon's top or bottom lines. Amazon is a resilient company, even during dismal economic times.
For example, the company's sales rose 29% during the 2008 financial crisis, and in the first year of the COVID pandemic, its revenue increased 22%. People can buy nearly anything they need on Amazon's marketplace. During downturns, customers may shift their spending habits on the platform, but not abandon it entirely.
Amazon holds a dominant e-commerce position, with about 40% market share. That easily outpaces its closest rival, Walmart, which has about 5% of the market. Americans aren't likely to stop buying goods online even during a recession, so this strong position gives Amazon the upper hand in riding out a slowdown.
And while I've focused mostly on Amazon's e-commerce business, the company makes half of its operating income from its cloud computing services, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This segment should help fuel Amazon's growth, because companies are ramping up artificial intelligence cloud computing spending.
Goldman Sachs estimates that global AI cloud computing sales will reach $2 trillion over the next five years, and Amazon is sure to benefit. The company holds 30% of the cloud market, with Microsoft in second place with 21%. Companies are locked in an AI race right now, and even a downturn is unlikely to stop them from spending to stay ahead of the competition.
I don't think Amazon is immune from a severe economic slowdown, but the company's dominant position in cloud computing and e-commerce can likely soften the blow if a recession occurs.
More importantly, long-term investors should remember that buying a stock means you have an optimistic outlook for the company for many years to come. Even if we get a slowdown, Amazon's shares are cheaper than they were just a few months ago.
Buying the stock now, at a discount, could prove to be a smart move even if there's more uncertainty down the road. Amazon's lead in cloud computing and e-commerce isn't going away anytime soon.

Key Points
One of the key priorities for new Intel (INTC 0.70%) CEO Lip-Bu Tan is to turn the company's foundry business into a success. The Intel 18A process node, which features multiple technological innovations and should challenge market leader TSMC in terms of performance and efficiency, is ready for production. The challenge now is to scale up and fill that capacity with new customer orders.
According to UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri, Intel is closing in on scoring Nvidia (NVDA -1.42%) as a foundry customer. While Intel has both Microsoft and Amazon on board as Intel 18A customers, winning over the largest fabless chip designer by revenue would be an enormous vote of confidence in Intel's foundry business.
There are two compelling reasons why Nvidia may be keen on shifting some production from TSMC to Intel. First, the company is struggling to provide enough gaming GPUs to meet demand. Nvidia recently launched its RTX 50 series graphics cards, but supply has been extremely tight, leading to prices well above MSRP.
Nvidia makes a lot more money selling data center GPUs aimed at AI workloads than it does from gaming GPUs, so it makes sense that artificial intelligence (AI) chips would be the priority. Nvidia only has so much manufacturing capacity at TSMC, and the company would be leaving money on the table if it didn't go all out to meet soaring demand for AI accelerators.
If Nvidia were to shift gaming GPU production to Intel while leaving AI chip production at TSMC, the company would likely have an easier time meeting demand for both products. The longer it takes Nvidia to meet demand from gamers, the more likely it becomes that those gamers give up and move over to GPUs from AMD. AMD's latest RX 9000 graphics cards are impressive, and Nvidia may be losing market share thanks to the rough supply situation.
Second, shifting some production to Intel's U.S.-based foundries would mesh well with the current political climate and avoid potential future tariffs on products coming from Taiwan. The Trump administration is pushing the idea of bringing manufacturing back from overseas, and Nvidia could score some points with a splashy announcement to do exactly that.
Even if this Nvidia rumor is true and the GPU giant ultimately chooses Intel for some production, it would take time for revenue to start rolling in. Any deal would involve a future Nvidia product, potentially the company's next-generation gaming graphics cards, which almost certainly won't launch until 2026 at the earliest.
While winning Nvidia as a foundry customer won't help Intel's financial results in the near term, it would certainly boost investor sentiment. Right now, the jury is still out on whether the Intel 18A process will be a success. Intel's own products built on the process aren't coming until later this year, and it's unclear when third-party products will start being produced in volume. Winning Nvidia as a customer would give investors confidence that Intel 18A is the real deal, and it could lead to a snowball effect as additional chip designers take a serious look.
There's no guarantee that Nvidia will opt for Intel's foundry services. However, if Intel can win over the leading AI chip designer, it would provide an early win for Tan and a much-needed boost for the struggling company. A big piece of good news from the foundry business could be enough to push Intel stock out of the doldrums and deliver solid gains for patient investors.

Rising Demand from Small and Medium Enterprises: The growing demand from small and medium enterprises (SMEs) is likely to present substantial opportunities for the growth of the big data analytics market during the forecast period. SMEs are often characterized by their agility and adaptability, enabling them to develop tailored solutions that meet specific customer needs more effectively than larger corporations. SMEs, which represented approximately 99% of all businesses in the European Union in 2022, are often more agile and innovative and adopt advanced technologies such as big data analytics to enhance operational efficiency. Moreover, in 2021, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), SMEs play a crucial role in the economic growth of many countries, contributing approximately 50% of total employment and 40% of gross domestic product (GDP). Further, according to the study conducted by the Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) in 2024, many SMEs are missing out on significant cost-saving opportunities by not utilizing data analytics. The study further reveals that businesses implementing data analytics can reduce operational costs by up to 10%, as the technology helps identify inefficiencies in supply chains and staffing models.

Key Points
Google just made its biggest acquisition of all time.
It's been a turbulent year for cybersecurity company CrowdStrike¬†(CRWD -1.43%) Last July, a glitch was identified during an update to CrowdStrike's software -- ultimately resulting in widespread outages across the world for many of its customers.
Reputational damages and frustrated customers were some of the more obvious near-term headwinds the company had to face. Over the last several quarters, CrowdStrike has moved on from its IT disaster with little noticeable harm.
I say this because the company, by most accounts, looks OK considering how detrimental this problem could have become. However, a more thorough review of the financials may suggest CrowdStrike is at a crossroads.
Revenue growth is beginning to show some signs of deceleration, and an intense competitive landscape in the cybersecurity industry doesn't necessarily bode well for investor confidence.
With that in mind, Google, a subsidiary of internet behemoth Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)¬†(NASDAQ: GOOG), just shook things up in the cybersecurity market with a pretty interesting move.
Let's dig into Google's playbook and assess if the company just made a checkmate move against CrowdStrike.
Alphabet is primarily affiliated with two internet brands: search platform Google and video-sharing website YouTube. In addition to these assets, Alphabet also has a workplace productivity suite similar to that of Microsoft Office, as well as a budding cloud computing business.
Alphabet has also been quietly making moves in cybersecurity. Back in 2022, Google shelled out a combined $5.9 billion to acquire cybersecurity companies Siemplify and Mandiant. Interestingly, the company has integrated both of these security businesses into the Google Cloud Platform, which is now growing faster than Alphabet's legacy advertising business, as well as its subscription services division. 
Earlier this month, Google doubled down on its cybersecurity playbook following a $32 billion acquisition of Wiz. Of note, this deal represents the largest reported price for an acquisition made by Google.
Image source: Getty Images.
Since Wiz is a private company, it's hard to know for sure just how big it is. Last summer, there was some talk that Google approached Wiz about an acquisition but the negotiations apparently fell through. At the time, Wiz was rumored to be generating around $500 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR). According to more recent reports, Wiz's ARR is now closer to $700 million.
Using these figures as estimates, this implies that Google shelled out between 45 times and 64 times ARR to acquire Wiz.
To put this into perspective, let's look at CrowdStrike's financials.
As of the company's fiscal 2025 year end (period ended Jan. 31), CrowdStrike boasted $4.2 billion in ARR. With a current market capitalization of $91.3 billion, CrowdStrike is trading for approximately 21.7 times ARR. In other words, CrowdStrike's ARR is about sixfold compared to Wiz but its valuation multiple is much more protracted.
In my eyes, Google may have overpaid for Wiz.
The deal between Wiz and Google comes at an interesting time for a couple of reasons. First, CrowdStrike is likely going to continue battling some brand fatigue despite the outage being almost a year ago at this point.
However, considering the price tag attached to the Wiz acquisition, I think Wall Street is likely going to place some heavy scrutiny on Google. More specifically, Google now has some pressure to integrate Wiz into its cloud business quickly and begin monetizing Wiz in tandem with Siemplify and Mandiant.
Second, CrowdStrike operates at the intersection of cybersecurity and artificial intelligence (AI) -- both of which are expanding market opportunities. It's interesting to see Google swoop in and acquire Wiz now as demand for both enhanced security protocols and AI software continues to rise.
To me, Wiz and Google will be spending quite a bit of time with deal-closing procedures (i.e., regulatory approvals), as well as administrative things such as organizational integrations and complementing the Wiz product suite with Google's existing cybersecurity services. These distractions could provide CrowdStrike with a unique opportunity to capitalize on strong market dynamics in the cybersecurity arena and move faster than its competition.
At the end of the day, I think the Wiz-Google acquisition could actually serve as a catalyst and benefit CrowdStrike. Overall, I don't see Google's deal as a checkmate move against CrowdStrike.

Microsoft stock went nowhere for over a decade, and Apple stock may do the same.
Apple (AAPL 0.89%) is a highly valued company that may take years to grow into its current valuation. We've seen this before with Microsoft (MSFT 0.04%), and it took more than a decade for the stock to make investors money. Travis Hoium highlights the comparison in this video.

From broadband internet and mobile phones to cash-free societies, digital government and cloud computing, Nordic countries‚Äô early adoption of innovations has often given their companies a head start.¬†
The quick response that helped Nokia, Skype, Spotify and Klarna dominate their industries is now benefiting Nordic companies in emerging fields such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and cloud software.
‚ÄúOnce you are an early starter in this industry‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâyou have an advantage,‚Äù says Benny Guttman, senior partner at the consultancy Roland Berger, of the EV charging market.
Norway has been the global leader in the transition to EVs since 2013, when the Tesla Model S was the best-selling car, surpassing petrol rivals. Last year, 89 per cent of new car sales in Norway were pure electric, while in Denmark the figure was 52 per cent. In Sweden, 32 per cent of sales were electric, and 58 per cent with plug-in hybrids, while in Finland the figures were 29 per cent and 69 per cent.

Kempower, a Finnish charging hardware company which is eighth in the FT1000 ranking of Europe‚Äôs Fastest Growing Companies, and Virta (ranked 283rd), a Finnish company which focuses on charging software and payment solutions, have both benefited from the early rollout of EV charging networks in the region.
‚ÄúNordic countries have been [among] the most advanced players in incentivising this transition and this has brought the technologies forward, and then the market,‚Äù says Jussi Palola, chief innovation officer and co-founder at Virta.
He also credits the Finnish government for launching a ‚Ç¨110mn project to fund research on EV charging systems in 2011, which led to the creation of Virta and Kempower. ‚ÄúThe logic from the Finnish perspective was that this transition is essential, it is going to happen, and we want to lead the technologies in this area,‚Äù Palola says.
Company purchases of electric vehicles for employees, encouraged by tax incentives, helped spur the development of the market in Sweden, with the EV share of company purchases growing from 16 per cent in 2018 to 74 per cent in 2023.
The high-profile collapse of Swedish battery maker Northvolt sent shockwaves through the renewables sector. But Guttman dismisses fears of a backlash after recent US policy shifts.
Nordic companies have shown a similar openness to innovation when adopting software solutions to make processes such as hiring, accounting, marketing and sales more efficient.
This openness comes down to the level of trust, transparency and positive experience with digitisation in each of the Nordic countries
‚ÄúThe level of digitisation and the openness towards digitisation is just next level,‚Äù says Milos L√∏rup Bartosek, an Oslo-based director at the consultancy Strategy&, part of PwC. ‚ÄúThis openness comes down to the level of trust, transparency and positive experience with digitisation in each of the Nordic countries, which is much higher than we observe‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâ.‚Äâin the UK and Germany.‚Äù
This openness has helped power the rapid growth of companies such as Sweden‚Äôs Teamtailor and Funnel, Norway‚Äôs Omnium, and Finland‚Äôs Epassi, which help companies with recruitment, sales, order management and employee benefits respectively. Of the 42 Nordic companies in the ranking, 12 offer some kind of cloud-based subscription software service to other businesses.
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not necessarily the next Microsoft, but they find very strong niches in which you can build businesses with revenues in the hundreds of millions of euros‚Äù, Bartosek says of the business-to-business software-as-a-service or ‚ÄúB2B SaaS‚Äù sector.
The key, as outlined in a Strategy& Nordic sector report, has been providing ‚Äúan incredibly strong value proposition‚Äù to customers, especially in the small and medium sized business segment. This helps them to carry out key functions better with fewer staff, so that savings and improved performance more than cover the cost of subscription.
Trust also fosters co-operation between Nordic companies. Virta has made KemPower a preferred hardware partner and the SaaS companies offer integrations with dozens of other similar businesses, both Nordic and international.
‚ÄúNordic companies tend to collaborate,‚Äù Guttman says, noting that ‚Äúthere are clear benefits to being Nordic in another Nordic country‚Äù.
As well as a receptive regional customer base, the region also has hubs and incubators for start-ups, seed capital from government agencies and angel investors, and growth capital from investors such as Sweden‚Äôs Creandum, Norway‚Äôs Verdane, and Denmark‚Äôs ByFounders.

Most of these companies have continued to grow despite a slowdown in Nordic economies in recent years. GDP in Finland and Sweden shrank by 1.2 and 0.3 per cent respectively in 2023, while that of Norway, excluding oil and gas, grew by 0.5 per cent. While there were signs of recovery in 2024, growth remains weak, with Sweden‚Äôs and mainland Norway‚Äôs economies growing by 1 per cent and 0.6 per cent respectively, while Finland‚Äôs shrank by 0.5 per cent.¬†
Denmark‚Äôs economy has been the exception, with GDP growth of 2.5 per cent in 2023 and 3.2 per cent in 2024, thanks partly to the success of Novo Nordisk‚Äôs obesity drug Wegovy.
The B2B SaaS companies have been resilient primarily because most offer ways for their customers to cut costs. The shift to EVs, meanwhile, is continuing, despite the economic slowdown and the removal of subsidies.
‚ÄúOf course, the global economic turmoil has slowed down some markets,‚Äù says Palola. But he predicts revenue growth this year, with Europe‚Äôs EV fleet to increase by 20 to 25 per cent.
A bigger threat is competition. Advanced AI companies now threaten B2B SaaS by fully automating tasks such businesses had only helped clients to do more efficiently.
‚ÄúThe big question for every B2B SaaS company is how it will be able to integrate itself into the AI ecosystem, and how to develop its own agents using AI,‚Äù Bartosek says.
Vehicle-charging companies, meanwhile, face competition from lower cost Chinese rivals and larger European and US companies.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to be a little bit tougher going forward for these companies, especially those that don‚Äôt have positive cash flows,‚Äù Guttman says. ‚ÄúSome will go out of business, some will be bought up, and some will thrive.‚Äù"

The analysts, who rattled investors with a February note highlighting leases Microsoft had abandoned in the US, said the latest move also reflected the company‚Äôs choice to forgo some new business from ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which it has backed with some US$13 billion.
Microsoft and the start-up earlier this year said they had altered their multi-year agreement, letting OpenAI use cloud-computing services from other companies, provided Microsoft did not want the business itself.
Microsoft‚Äôs retrenchment in the last six months included lease cancellations and deferrals, the TD Cowen analysts said in their latest research note, dated Wednesday. Alphabet‚Äôs Google had stepped in to grab some leases Microsoft abandoned in Europe, the analysts wrote, while Meta Platforms had scooped up some of the freed capacity in Europe.
‚ÄúThanks to the significant investments we have made up to this point, we are well positioned to meet our current and increasing customer demand,‚Äù a Microsoft representative said in a statement, adding that the company last year added more capacity than in any other year in its history."

Key Points
After a bit of a rebound, the Nasdaq Composite index is no longer officially in correction territory, for now at least, down by just 9% from the recent highs as of this writing. However, when it comes to finding excellent ETFs, there are still some excellent bargains for long-term investors.
With that in mind, here are two ETFs, one passive index fund and one actively managed fund, that concentrate on technology stocks and are still down by more than 10%.
The Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT -1.04%) is an index fund offered by low-cost fund provider Vanguard, and with a 0.09% expense ratio, it's one of the cheapest ways to get broad technology exposure. Even after the market's recent rebound, it's still more than 11% below its 2025 peak.
In a nutshell, this is a fund that tracks the overall information technology sector, more commonly referred to as simply ""the tech sector."" It's a weighted index of about 315 stocks, and as you might expect, it's heavily weighted toward some of the Magnificent Seven stocks. In fact, the fund's top three holdings -- Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft -- make up 46% of the assets.
Interestingly, some of the largest tech companies, such as Amazon.com, Alphabet (Google's parent company), and Tesla are notably absent, as they aren't technically included in the information technology sector. But this ETF can be an excellent way to get exposure to some of the hottest technology trends, and for a significantly lower price than you would have paid earlier this year.
The Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK -0.97%) is the largest ETF offered by notable tech investor Cathie Wood's Ark Invest. After the recent market volatility, it still trades for about 21% below its February peak, even after a bit of a rebound.
This is an actively managed ETF, not an index fund, which means that portfolio managers (in this case, Cathie Wood) select stocks with the goal of beating a certain benchmark index. And this is a portfolio of about 36 excellent technology stocks, many of which have been beaten down in this year's market turbulence despite being great businesses with tremendous potential. 
Just to name a few, the fund's top five holdings are Tesla, Roku, Roblox, Coinbase, and Palantir. You'll also find several other major tech stocks, as well as some small caps that Wood and her team feel have a lot of potential.
The Ark Innovation ETF has a 0.75% expense ratio, which is higher than you'd expect from the typical index fund but is on par with what other actively managed funds charge.
In full disclosure, I already own a different Cathie Wood ETF in my portfolio, the Ark Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (ARKQ -1.17%). I bought that one specifically for AI exposure. But the Ark Innovation ETF seems like an attractive way to get exposure to some of the highest-potential technology stocks at a discount, and it's on my watch list right now.
Although I think these both look appealing right now, it's important to emphasize that I'm saying that from a long-term perspective. I have no idea what the market, or these two funds, will do over the coming weeks or months, and if we get more market volatility, it's entirely possible they could fall further. However, if you measure your investment returns in periods of multiple years, now could be a great time to take a closer look.

Key Points
Shares of most artificial intelligence (AI)-related semiconductor stocks, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM -3.13%), Broadcom (AVGO -4.11%), and Marvell Technology (MRVL -3.18%), were falling hard on Wednesday, down 4.5%, 4.3%, and 6.6%, respectively, as of 12:49 p.m. ET.
Most AI-related hardware stocks, including Nvidia, were down sharply on three bits of news. One, the U.S. added about 50 Chinese companies and 80 total companies to the export ""entity list,"" which could restrict semiconductor sales globally.
Second, analysts at TD Cowen released a note today saying that Microsoft¬†had canceled some data center projects totaling about 2 gigawatts (GW), which is a significant amount.
Finally, President Donald Trump made comments that suggested he may follow through on more tariffs than investors might have expected at the beginning of the week.
On Wednesday, the Trump administration added about 80 companies to the U.S. ""entity list,"" which restricts certain chipmakers from selling their products to those companies without getting a specific government permit. The newly added companies are now restricted due to either allegedly aiding China's military modernization or participating in China's quantum computing research efforts.
What might have been particularly worrying about today's restrictions isn't the 50 Chinese companies added, but rather the 30 companies based outside of China that were also added. These other countries listed included the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, Iran, and Taiwan -- although the one Taiwanese company appears to be a subsidiary of Chinese server giant Inspur.  Recently, there have been concerns China has been able to smuggle in restricted AI chips through third parties, so it's not a surprise to see more restrictions come out.
While many Chinese companies were already on the entity list going back years, announcements like these usually spur a sell-off in semiconductor stocks.  That's because the new restrictions could cut off some existing sales to these non-China third parties.
If the new restrictions cause a fall-off in sales growth, that would certainly affect TSMC, which makes Nvidia's chips and many other associated semiconductors that go into AI systems. While Broadcom and Marvell have ridden custom AI silicon made for cloud giants to new heights in recent years, and those cloud customers won't be affected, both companies also sell lots of data center networking equipment to all parties.
In their recent annual reports, Broadcom noted about 20% of its revenue came from China last year, while Marvell got a whopping 43% of revenue from China.  Both companies also noted shipments to China don't necessarily mean the end customer is Chinese, but could rather be a U.S. or European company that has assembly, test, or distribution operations in China.

Another potentially worrying announcement came from analysts at TD Cowen, which said it believes Microsoft has canceled data center projects totaling 2 GW. That's a fair amount of capacity, and likely raised concerns the global AI buildout may be slowing or even reversing. A slower build of AI data centers would obviously affect all three stocks listed above. 
Adding to the worries, news came over the wires that Trump would be making an announcement regarding auto tariffs today. While the market had thought the administration was relaxing its stance on tariffs earlier this week, the uncertainty could be causing traders to sell ahead of the announcement.  
Certainly, the combination of the China trade restrictions and news of Microsoft canceling data center projects is a toxic brew for AI chip stocks.
However, it's also not a reason for panic. The Cowen note elaborated Microsoft's cancellations appear specifically due to abandoning buildouts to support OpenAI training clusters. While Microsoft owns a significant stake in OpenAI, there has been increasing competition in large language models recently, most notably from the low-cost R1 model from Chinese company DeepSeek.
Microsoft said in a statement in response to the report that while it may ""strategically pace or adjust our infrastructure in some areas, we will continue to grow strongly in all regions.""
Reading the tea leaves, the cancellations may merely be Microsoft not wanting to spend even more money to support OpenAI specifically, which Microsoft may now doubt will prevail in the AI races. But if that's the case, OpenAI will probably look to other infrastructure providers such as the recently announced Stargate project announced in collaboration with non-Microsoft tech giants.
Thus, the sell-off in AI chip stocks may be overblown if that's the case. On that note, the TD Cowen analysts also noted that other large cloud providers had back-filled some of the projects that Microsoft had abandoned.
AI computing still looks set to grow over time. With AI stocks now having highly discounted valuations relative to where they were this past summer, long-term focused investors may want to put together a ""buy list"" of potential AI winners that have been beaten up.

In the fast-paced and highly competitive business world of today, conducting thorough company analysis is essential for investors and industry observers. In this article, we will conduct an extensive industry comparison, evaluating Microsoft MSFT in relation to its major competitors in the Software industry. Through a detailed examination of key financial metrics, market standing, and growth prospects, our objective is to provide valuable insights and illuminate company's performance in the industry.
Microsoft develops and licenses consumer and enterprise software. It is known for its Windows operating systems and Office productivity suite. The company is organized into three equally sized broad segments: productivity and business processes (legacy Microsoft Office, cloud-based Office 365, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype, LinkedIn, Dynamics), intelligence cloud (infrastructure- and platform-as-a-service offerings Azure, Windows Server OS, SQL Server), and more personal computing (Windows Client, Xbox, Bing search, display advertising, and Surface laptops, tablets, and desktops).
After a detailed analysis of Microsoft, the following trends become apparent: 
The stock's Price to Earnings ratio of 31.84 is lower than the industry average by 0.39x, suggesting potential value in the eyes of market participants.
Considering a Price to Book ratio of 9.7, which is well below the industry average by 0.41x, the stock may be undervalued based on its book value compared to its peers.
The Price to Sales ratio of 11.28, which is 1.39x the industry average, suggests the stock could potentially be overvalued in relation to its sales performance compared to its peers.
With a Return on Equity (ROE) of 8.17% that is 0.76% above the industry average, it appears that the company exhibits efficient use of equity to generate profits.
The company exhibits higher Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization (EBITDA) of $36.79 Billion, which is 56.6x above the industry average, implying stronger profitability and robust cash flow generation.
The gross profit of $47.83 Billion is 35.17x above that of its industry, highlighting stronger profitability and higher earnings from its core operations.
The company is witnessing a substantial decline in revenue growth, with a rate of 12.27% compared to the industry average of 12.5%, which indicates a challenging sales environment.

The debt-to-equity (D/E) ratio indicates the proportion of debt and equity used by a company to finance its assets and operations.
Considering the debt-to-equity ratio in industry comparisons allows for a concise evaluation of a company's financial health and risk profile, aiding in informed decision-making.
In light of the Debt-to-Equity ratio, a comparison between Microsoft and its top 4 peers reveals the following information:
In terms of the debt-to-equity ratio, Microsoft has a lower level of debt compared to its top 4 peers, indicating a stronger financial position.
This implies that the company relies less on debt financing and has a more favorable balance between debt and equity with a lower debt-to-equity ratio of 0.21.
For Microsoft in the Software industry, the PE and PB ratios suggest the stock is undervalued compared to peers, indicating potential for growth. However, the high PS ratio implies the stock may be overvalued based on revenue. On the other hand, the high ROE, EBITDA, and gross profit indicate strong profitability and operational efficiency, while the low revenue growth suggests slower expansion compared to industry peers.

Key Points
The stock market downturn has created a rare opportunity to purchase several high-quality stocks at discounted valuation levels.
The U.S. equity market began 2025 on a positive note, with the S&P 500 index increasing nearly 2.8% in January 2025. Market sentiment was largely optimistic, fueled by strong earnings from artificial intelligence (AI)-powered companies and optimism about a resilient economy.
However, things have worsened, as growing geopolitical tensions, rising economic uncertainty, and the increasing probability of trade wars are affecting investor confidence. The Nasdaq Composite spent much of March in correction territory, 10% off its highs.
But this challenging period of market sell-offs also offers some of the best long-term buying opportunities, particularly for stocks of high-quality companies with sustainable competitive advantages and strong financials, as they trade at discounted prices.
Here's my list of three top-notch AI-powered stocks that have become bargain buys.
Shares of Nvidia (NVDA -1.42%) have plummeted more than 20% from their recent high of $153 on Jan. 7, triggered mainly by worries about AI overspending and trade wars.
Despite this slump, the rapid pace of AI infrastructure buildout is the primary growth catalyst for Nvidia, a semiconductor giant accounting for almost 90% of the AI GPU market. With major technology companies gearing up to spend over $300 billion on AI technologies and data center buildouts in 2025, Nvidia's AI GPUs and AI-optimized software solutions continue to be in high demand.
Demand for the recently launched Blackwell architecture systems is already surpassing supply. Designed mainly for inference workloads (deploying and running pre-trained large language models), including reasoning (a special inference use case),
Blackwell is well-suited for advanced models that utilize large amounts of computing power and perform complicated and multistep tasks. By focusing on the recurring inference workloads (compared to training workloads), Nvidia is now targeting a much larger addressable market.
Furthermore, Nvidia's tightly integrated software ecosystem has a significant competitive advantage since it has helped create a sticky customer base by dramatically increasing clients' switching costs.
Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang also announced plans to launch Rubin GPU, the successor to Blackwell GPUs, in the second half of 2027 in a speech at the recent GTC conference focused on AI development.
Despite the many pros, Nvidia is trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 27.1, far lower than its five-year average of 72. Considering Nvidia's enviable position in the rapidly expanding AI market and valuation correction, it seems an unmissable buying opportunity.
Shares of Meta Platforms (META -0.92%) have also fallen significantly, around 19% from its 52-week high of $740.91 on Feb. 14. Yet, the unparalleled strength of its core family of apps (including Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, Threads, and WhatsApp) and robust AI initiatives position it for a solid recovery in the coming months.
With over 3.3 billion daily active users using at least one of its social media applications in December 2024, Meta enjoys access to vast amounts of real-time data about customer interests, preferences, behavior, and spending patterns. This data is then analyzed using advanced AI technologies to optimize content recommendation algorithms, which helps boost user engagement further.
This has translated into robust growth for Meta's advertising business, which raked in revenue of $46.8 billion in the fourth quarter of 2024, up 21% year over year. The company benefits from increased advertiser demand and ad pricing on its platforms -- mainly due to its robust ad targeting capabilities.
Meta is also investing heavily in AI initiatives. In fiscal 2025, the company plans to spend around $60 billion to $65 billion on AI-related data center buildouts and other initiatives. The company is a frontrunner in the agentic AI space with its widely used Meta AI assistant. The company is also making strides in the open-source large language model development space.
Meta also boasts a strong balance sheet, with $77.8 billion in cash and $49.8 billion in debt. Yet, its valuation seems quite reasonable, with a forward P/E ratio of 23.9 -- lower than those of technology giants Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon, which enjoy similar competitive advantages in their respective industries. Hence, Meta seems a compelling buy for astute investors in 2025.
Finally, Oracle (ORCL -1.76%) stock has also seen a lot of volatility, with shares trading 23% lower from their 52-week high of $198 this past Dec. 9. The sharp drop has provided an attractive entry point for investors, considering Oracle's remarkable growth trajectory in the cloud infrastructure business and rapid progress in AI initiatives.
Oracle's remaining performance obligations (RPO, a measure of future revenue from existing contracts) totaled $130 billion at the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2025 (ended Dec. 31, 2024), a 63% increase year over year. Since cloud RPO grew 90% year over year and accounted for nearly 80% of the overall RPO, this metric strongly indicates demand for the company's cloud services. Furthermore, with 31% of the RPO expected to be recognized in the next 12 months, Oracle benefits from significant revenue visibility.
Oracle's cloud infrastructure (OCI) business clocked an annualized revenue of $10.6 billion. Oracle also focuses on expanding its live data center count and power capacity to convert RPO into actual revenue. With the current demand for cloud services outstripping supply, OCI's revenue growth pace can further accelerate with increased data center capacity.
The company is also making rapid progress in AI training and inferencing. Oracle's AI-related GPU consumption revenue was almost 3.5 times higher at the end of the third quarter than those earned in the prior year. Furthermore, Oracle invests heavily in building AI GPU clusters alone or in partnership with other companies. Oracle has also developed an AI Data Platform, to enable clients to use leading large language models from different sources to analyze their data stored in Oracle databases.
Oracle is also a part of Project Stargate, an AI infrastructure investment initiative worth $500 billion, backed by the U.S. government. While Stargate has not yet contributed to Oracle's RPO growth, it can be a significant growth catalyst in the coming months.
Yet, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 21.5, lower than its historical five-year average multiple of 32.8. Against this backdrop, any major positive news could push up the company's share prices in 2025.

In today‚Äôs Market Clubhouse Morning Memo, we will discuss SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, NVDA, GOOGL, META, and TSLA.
Our proprietary formula, exclusive to Market Clubhouse, dictates these price levels. This dynamic equation takes into account price, volume, and options flow. These levels are updated every day and shared with all Clubhouse Members, prior to the opening of the market.
We recommend closely monitoring these stocks, and be prepared to leverage potential breakouts or reversals. As always, stay alert and ready to adjust your tactics based on the market‚Äôs pulse to optimize your trading gains. Now, let‚Äôs dive into the stock analysis:
SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY)
The SPY is currently trading near our pivotal mark of 574.65. Buyers must initially push prices above 575.67 to demonstrate momentum. If buying persists above this area, expect bulls to challenge the next critical zone at 576.62. Maintaining strength at 576.62 through the trading session could propel SPY upward, targeting resistance at 577.87. Our top bullish goal today for SPY is set at 579.12.
Should 574.65 fail as support, sellers will aim lower, challenging 573.50 to test bullish commitment. A breach here would likely accelerate bearish action, driving price toward 572.15. Persistent selling momentum beneath this level would next target the critical support at 571.06. On a particularly aggressive selling day, SPY could reach our ultimate bearish objective of 569.98.
Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ)
The QQQ is presently hovering around our essential price of 493.60. Bulls need to maintain and stabilize price action here, pushing higher to reclaim 495.35 decisively. If successful, bullish traders could drive prices upward to challenge 496.94 next. With sustained buying strength, further gains toward 498.37 become likely, putting our peak bullish target for today at 499.44 within reach.
If bulls fail to defend 493.60 intraday, expect bearish pressure to quickly drive prices toward the downside level at 491.82. Continued weakness could extend declines to 490.05, with further aggressive selling potentially targeting support at 487.69. A failure to stabilize here could cause prices to tumble further toward our low bearish target today at 486.10.
Apple Inc. (AAPL)
Apple is currently trading close to our crucial pivot at 223.87. Buyers must secure this as reliable support, creating momentum toward the next upside target at 225.31. Should bullish participants continue to dominate price action, Apple shares could advance further to test 226.08. If momentum remains robust throughout the session, expect Apple to challenge our primary bullish target today at 226.90.
If price action fails to maintain 223.87 intraday, selling pressure will likely push Apple lower, initially targeting 222.96. Continued weakness would encourage bearish traders to seek further downside toward 222.24. If selling pressure persists below this area, expect Apple to test support at 221.66, potentially falling further toward today‚Äôs lower bearish target at 220.97.
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT)
Microsoft is currently navigating around our key intraday level of 394.46. Bullish momentum must emerge above this level, lifting the price to test the next significant zone at 395.68, which bulls must maintain decisively as support. Achieving stability here could generate a continued upward move to challenge 397.65. With sustained bullish engagement, Microsoft could reach today‚Äôs bullish target of 398.38.
If Microsoft falters at 394.46, sellers will likely apply pressure, testing support at 393.47. A clear breakdown below this area would indicate weakening momentum, targeting lower levels at 392.49. If bears gain stronger momentum, price action might extend declines toward 390.98, with our bottom bearish objective today established at 389.29.
NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA)
NVIDIA currently trades around our crucial mark of 119.44. Bulls must rapidly advance the price to test and reclaim support at 120.27. Successful bullish action here could fuel a drive higher, targeting 121.97 next. Continued strong buying throughout today‚Äôs session could carry NVIDIA toward further resistance at 123.41, ultimately approaching our high bullish goal today of 125.21.
Should NVIDIA fail to maintain stability at 119.44, bears will press the price downward, initially targeting 117.86. Continued selling below this level could further weaken the market, leading NVIDIA toward support at 116.61. Persistent downside action may extend toward 115.83, with an aggressive bearish scenario placing today‚Äôs lowest target at 115.15.
Alphabet Inc Class A (GOOGL)
Alphabet is currently trading around our crucial pivot of 169.34. Bulls need to firmly hold this level to build upward momentum toward 171.14. Sustained bullish activity here could propel Alphabet‚Äôs price toward our primary bullish target for the session at 172.28.
A failure at 169.34 during today's trading would trigger bearish momentum, driving Alphabet initially toward 167.04. Increased selling could lead to further downside action toward 165.41. Persistent bearish strength could ultimately push Alphabet toward our lowest bearish target today at 163.79.
Meta Platforms Inc (META)
Meta is presently positioned around our important intraday level of 629.88. Buyers need to establish firm support here, launching price action toward 635.49. Sustained buying activity could further elevate Meta shares toward 642.59. Continued bullish conviction today would enable traders to push prices toward our ultimate bullish target at 646.48.
Should Meta fail to secure 629.88 as intraday support, sellers will target the lower support at 622.01. Continued bearish activity could further pressure price toward 615.65. In the event of sustained selling intensity, bears may ultimately drive prices down to today‚Äôs bearish target at 609.30.
Tesla Inc. (TSLA)
Tesla is currently trading around our significant pivot level of 283.95. Bulls should actively push price above this zone to initially challenge 286.34. With ongoing bullish activity, price momentum could reach higher resistance at 288.80. If overall market strength remains supportive, Tesla may extend its rally toward 290.47. Exceptional bullish interest could propel prices to our upper bullish objective for Tesla today at 293.21.
If bulls are unable to secure 283.95 as firm support, anticipate bearish traders driving Tesla toward lower levels starting at 281.32. Continued bearish pressure would likely encourage further selling toward 279.43. A clear breakdown below this support could result in aggressive selling, ultimately targeting our lowest bearish objective for Tesla today at 278.11.
Final Word:
Today's economic calendar is relatively sparse but still noteworthy. At 8:30 AM ET, markets receive the Preliminary Durable Goods Orders and Preliminary Capital Goods Orders data for February, providing insight into the underlying health of the manufacturing and industrial sectors. Additionally, the U.S. Treasury will conduct auctions at 11:30 AM ET for the 2-Year Floating Rate Notes, followed by the 5-Year FRN auction at 1 PM ET. Traders should also pay attention to scheduled Federal Reserve commentary, starting with non-voter Kashkari at 10 AM ET, and more significantly, voting member Musalem at 1:10 PM ET, whose remarks could influence market perceptions on the Fed's future policy stance.
Given these events, traders should anticipate volatility during auction windows and Federal Reserve commentary, adjusting risk accordingly. Manage positions carefully, remain disciplined, and ensure proper risk protocols are followed. Good luck trading today!

Key Points
IBM's AI strategy is paying off with explosive acceleration after a slow start. Are you paying attention to this unsung hero of enterprise-class computing?
There are many reasons to invest in IBM (IBM -1.54%) these days. The centennial tech giant is a leading researcher in quantum computing. The stock trades at modest valuation ratios, like 18.5 times free cash flow and 21.6 times forward earnings. And Big Blue's 2.8% dividend yield is more than twice the average among S&P 500 (^GSPC -0.21%) stocks.
But one piece of my investment thesis for IBM weighs heavier than the rest. Above all, IBM is a powerhouse in business-class artificial intelligence (AI). The company has been preparing itself for this unique point in computing history, and AI growth should drive IBM stock much higher in the next few years.
IBM was quick to respond when OpenAI unleashed ChatGPT in November 2022. Six months later, Big Blue released the Watsonx platform of generative AI tools for corporate clients.
This system was always different from consumer-facing large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT or Alphabet's (GOOG -1.38%) (GOOGL -1.29%) Gemini. The IBM tools are focused squarely on enterprise-class customers, with features that your average consumer probably wouldn't care about.
Watsonx's data flows can be audited, from LLM-training inputs to final chatbot outputs. It was built to draw actionable conclusions directly from a company's proprietary information, while also protecting that information from outside access. This is a business tool, not a plaything.
Sales were slow at first. Software and service buyers in this category often insist on deep testing of any prospective big-ticket investment. The budgets also need rubber stamps, often from several layers of management. This stuff takes time, so IBM didn't exactly race out of the generative AI starting gates.
But the company reported more than $1 billion of Watsonx-based contracts in the first quarter of 2024 -- less than a year later. That ""book of business"" doubled to $2 billion in the next report, stepping up to $3 billion in the third quarter and over $5 billion by the end of the year.
The generative AI business is picking up steam quickly.
I'm not talking about straight-up software licenses. IBM supplements its software with a much larger helping of consulting services. About 80% of the order book held generative AI consulting contracts in the fourth quarter.
This is a business advantage other AI providers aren't even trying to copy. Microsoft (MSFT 0.04%) doesn't even mention its consulting business in recent earnings calls. The term was last mentioned in passing in January, 2023. It's just not a big deal to Microsoft. Alphabet spends even less conference-call time on consulting concepts, and the same goes for Amazon (AMZN 0.41%).
Consulting services are an afterthought for many tech titans. For IBM, they're a core business concept driving massive long-term contract values. In fact, many companies turn to IBM for support and integration services around their AI systems from other systems.
A $5 billion list of multiyear orders is still a drop in IBM's giant revenue bucket. The company collected $62.8 billion of top-line sales last year, generating $12.7 billion of free cash flow. But the AI-driven portion is growing quickly, and I can't wait to see how Watsonx's business develops in the long run.
This stock could double its cash flow-based valuation and still look like a bargain next to Amazon or Microsoft. Like IBM's business model, investors are taking their sweet time to embrace this unsung AI hero. That's fine, since it gives me more time to pick up IBM stock on the cheap. IBM remains one of my favorite AI investments in March 2025.

In 1999, a small graphics chipmaker called Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) went public at $12 per share. Today, that same company stands as the world's most valuable semiconductor giant. A modest $500 investment at Nvidia's IPO would have mushroomed into an astounding $1.61 million today -- a 322,600% return that dwarfs the S&P 500's performance over the same period.

NVDA Total Return Level data by YCharts
The potential for such transformative wealth creation has investors constantly hunting for the next technological revolution. Quantum computing may represent exactly that frontier, with IonQ (IONQ -3.43%) emerging as an early leader. While debates continue about development timelines, the technology's potential is undeniable.
McKinsey & Co. projects that quantum computing could generate trillions in economic value in the coming decades, revolutionizing industries from pharmaceuticals to logistics and cybersecurity. In fact, quantum computers' ability to break current encryption standards could trigger a complete overhaul of global security infrastructure, a testament to the sheer power of this technology that's still in the development phase.
Could quantum computing pioneer IonQ be the next Nvidia? Let's break down the company's core value proposition and take a look.
Image source: Getty Images.
IonQ recently reached a pivotal milestone that suggests that quantum computing's commercial viability will arrive sooner than many expected. Specifically, the company demonstrated that its quantum computer was 12% faster than classical computing alternatives when designing life-saving medical devices. This remarkable achievement represents one of the first documented cases of quantum computing delivering practical advantages in real-world applications.
The breakthrough came through a collaboration with engineering simulation company Ansys. Using IonQ's production quantum computer, the partners successfully simulated blood pump dynamics to optimize design and improve efficiency. The quantum-enhanced workflow handled up to 2.6 million vertices and 40 million edges, demonstrating significant improvements in solving complex simulations.
This performance advantage is particularly noteworthy because it occurred on IonQ's current-generation system rather than a theoretical future quantum computer. Furthermore, it says its versatile quantum optimization method can be applied to a diverse range of applications, including automotive safety, logistics optimization, and portfolio management.
IonQ's financial results reflect its accelerating commercial momentum. The company reported full-year 2024 revenue of $43.1 million, representing year-over-year growth of 95%. This exceeded the high end of the company's previously announced guidance range.
The company also recently strengthened its financial position through a successful equity offering. IonQ raised approximately $360 million in net proceeds from the offering, bringing its pro forma cash balance to over $700 million. This substantial war chest provides the financial resources necessary for continued research, development, and strategic acquisitions.
Despite IonQ's impressive technological and commercial progress, potential investors should consider several important factors. The company reported a net loss of $331.6 million for 2024, reflecting the substantial ongoing capital investments required to advance this emerging technology. While revenue is growing rapidly, profitability remains a distant goal.
The quantum computing space also faces significant competition from well-funded technology giants and specialized start-ups. Tech behemoths, including IBM, Alphabet, Microsoft, and various private competitors, are pursuing alternative approaches to quantum computing technology, creating a complex competitive landscape.
Furthermore, IonQ's current stock valuation reflects considerable optimism about its prospects. IonQ's shares presently trade at a whopping 31.2 times 2026 projected sales. That's a sizzling valuation no matter how you slice it.
For investors seeking exposure to the quantum computing revolution, IonQ presents a compelling but high-risk opportunity. The company has demonstrated real-world quantum advantage ahead of competitors and secured substantial financial resources to fund its ambitious growth plans.
While it's impossible to predict if IonQ will deliver Nvidia-like returns, the company has positioned itself at the forefront of a potentially transformative technology wave. Investors comfortable with the inherent volatility of emerging technology stocks might consider establishing a modest position as part of a diversified portfolio.

MSFT,Warren Buffett is totally crushing it this year,20250326,Somewhat-bullish,0.258031,"This story is available exclusively to Business Insider subscribers. Become an Insider and start reading now. Warren Buffett is off to a roaring start to 2025 with shares of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate up 16%, trouncing the benchmark S&P 500's 2% decline.",Business Insider,www.businessinsider.com,https://www.businessinsider.com/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-stock-market-cash-geico-abel-2025-3,"Warren Buffett is off to a roaring start to 2025 with shares of his Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate up 16%, trouncing the benchmark S&P 500's 2% decline.
The stock surge has boosted Buffett's net worth by an unmatched $23 billion, vaulting him past Bill Gates into sixth place on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, with a $165 billion fortune.
The 94-year-old business icon and his company are riding high as investors seek shelter from roiling markets, trusting the legendary bargain hunter to pounce if asset prices crash and the economy tanks.
They're also cheering a rebound at Geico, which is owned by Berkshire, and banking on Buffett's planned successor to deliver when the time comes.
""Berkshire is a stable, solid ship in a sea of uncertainty right now,"" Paul Lountzis, the president and founder of Lountzis Asset Management, told Business Insider.
The longtime Berkshire shareholder pointed to the company's ""rock of Gibraltar"" balance sheet, which boasted more than $320 billion in cash, Treasurys, and other liquid assets at the end of December, and stocks worth more than $270 billion.
During his 60 years in charge, Buffett has transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a¬†$1 trillion juggernaut. He's acquired scores of businesses across myriad industries, including See's Candies, Precision Castparts, and the BNSF Railway, and built multibillion-dollar stakes in blue-chip stocks such as Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express.
Berkshire stock has soared in value by more than 5,500,000% during Buffett's tenure, crushing the S&P's roughly 39,000% gain over the same period. The stock has compounded at about 20% a year for six decades ‚Äî almost twice as fast as the benchmark.
The billionaire philanthropist is also known for prudently managing Berkshire, prizing long-term success over short-term gains.
""In an uncertain world, investors place a higher value on the certainty that Berkshire offers,"" Darren Pollock, a portfolio manager at Cheviot Value Management and another longtime shareholder, told BI. ""Consistency and reliability often get a bid when froth exits financial markets.""
Cathy Seifert, a senior vice president at CFRA Research and a longtime Berkshire analyst, said there's been a ""flight to quality amid an upswing in market and geopolitical volatility,"" and investors see Buffett's sprawling empire as a safe haven.
Buffett is a value investor who specializes in spotting and scooping up stocks and businesses at a discount. The best time to do that is when prices tumble and the pool of buyers dries up.
""Warren Buffett has often demonstrated he is at his best with capital allocation with more challenging conditions,"" Macrae Sykes, a portfolio manager at Gabelli Funds, told BI. He's ""shown a unique ability to see through the noise and find value.""
For example, the legendary investor struck lucrative deals with Goldman Sachs, General Electric, Mars, Dow Chemical, and Swiss Re during the financial crisis.
He deployed more than $21 billion across those five transactions between 2008 and 2009, securing positions worth a combined $26 billion ‚Äî and yielding $2.1 billion in yearly interest and dividends ‚Äî by the end of 2009.
Fast-forward to today, and Berkshire's huge ""cash cushion"" gives it ""tremendous firepower for bargain hunting should opportunities arise,"" Pollock said.
Buffett's patience, discipline, and refusal to buy into bubbles and trendy stocks have paid off in the past. When the dot-com bubble burst and the S&P fell by an average of 14% a year between 2000 and 2002, Berkshire shares rose by 10% on average during those three years as investors dumped expensive tech stocks and returned to tried-and-true names.
Under Buffett's leadership, Berkshire stock ""substantially outperformed"" the market in 10 of the 12 years the S&P declined, David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland who's followed Buffett for four decades, told BI.
Berkshire's business performance has also made it a draw for investors. The company has some ""fundamental momentum,"" Sykes said, noting it generated about $30 billion in operating cash flow last year, or about $600 million a week.
Geico's profits soared last year as Todd Combs, the car insurer's CEO and one of Buffett's two investment managers, boosted efficiency and updated its underwriting practices.
Buffett described Geico as a ""long-held gem that needed major repolishing"" in his latest annual letter and hailed its recent performance as ""spectacular.""
The recovery helped lift Berkshire's operating earnings by 71% year-over-year last quarter. Kass said that was a key reason its shares have outpaced Magnificent Seven stocks such as Microsoft and Alphabet this year.
Seifert said the Geico turnaround should ""significantly aid"" Berkshire's profit growth given it's one of the company's most important business units. She also noted the Federal Reserve's hikes to interest rates since 2022 have made Berkshire's mountain of bonds more lucrative.
Buffett's company raked in nearly $22 billion in interest, dividend, and investment income last year, up from less than $16 billion in 2023 and about $10 billion in 2022.
Buffett and Berkshire have become virtually synonymous, making it hard to imagine another CEO filling his shoes. Yet the demise of his longtime business partner, Charlie Munger, a few weeks shy of his 100th birthday in late 2023, underscored the Buffett era is nearing an end.
Buffett has carefully planned for his departure and worked to build shareholders' comfort with Greg Abel, the head of Berkshire's non-insurance businesses and his chosen successor.
A final reason for Berkshire's stock gains this year is ""growing confidence"" in Abel's ability to make Berkshire's subsidiaries sing and shrewdly allocate the company's capital, Sykes said.
Buffett has ""done a great job preparing the firm for a future without him,"" Lountzis said. ""There is not much more he could do ‚Äî though I do wish he could clone himself and Charlie to keep running it for another 60 years.""
