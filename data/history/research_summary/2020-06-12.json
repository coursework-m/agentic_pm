    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has faced increased competition in the advertising market, which has led to a decline in its stock price. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand presence provide a solid foundation for long-term growth, the current market conditions make it a less attractive option."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has shown significant growth in its cloud and productivity segments, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure and Office 365 services.
