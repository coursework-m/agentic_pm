    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL has a strong fundamental profile with a high P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a positive outlook, with a high analyst recommendation score. However, the stock's price has been volatile, and the recent decline in price may be a correction. Therefore, I recommend a BUY recommendation for Apple Inc."

    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has a strong fundamental profile with a low P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. However, the company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a neutral outlook, with a moderate analyst recommendation score. The stock's price has been stable, but the recent increase in price may be due to a short squeeze. Therefore, I do not recommend holding Alphabet Inc. at this time."
