    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. Its strong brand, loyal customer base, and innovative products make it a compelling buy, despite its relatively high forward PE ratio of 23.5."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's high forward PE ratio of 18.8 and dependence on online advertising make it a less attractive buy. Although its diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a hold, its high valuation and vulnerability to changes in the digital advertising market make it a less desirable addition to a conservative portfolio."

    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT's high forward PE ratio of 30.1 and dependence on the software industry make it a less attractive buy. Although its diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a hold, its high valuation and vulnerability to changes in the software industry make it a less desirable addition to a conservative portfolio."
