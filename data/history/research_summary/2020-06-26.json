    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has faced challenges in the current market, with a decline in price and revenue growth. The company's forward PE ratio is relatively low, but the analyst recommendation score is neutral, and the diversified revenue streams may not be enough to offset the challenges."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has shown strong growth in its cloud and productivity segments, with a forward PE ratio of 30.1 and EPS of $12.92. However, the company's dependence on the cloud segment may make it vulnerable to market fluctuations, and a conservative allocation is recommended to balance the portfolio."
