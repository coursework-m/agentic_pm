    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong fundamental position with a PE ratio of 30.42 and EPS of 6.42, combined with a positive recent news and analyst recommendations score of 2.09, justify a BUY recommendation. However, the stock's price has been volatile, which is mitigated by the overall stability of the company."

    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's neutral recent news and analyst recommendations score of 1.58, combined with a stable stock price, do not justify a recommendation. The company's fundamental position is strong, but the neutral score suggests a HOLD is not warranted."
