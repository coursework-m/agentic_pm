    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. Its strong fundamentals, including a high P/E ratio and growing EPS, make it an attractive option for those looking to invest in the technology sector."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL's dependence on online advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to changes in the digital advertising market, and its relatively low beta of 1.01 does not justify a high allocation in a conservative portfolio."
  },
  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 2.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong position in the software industry, with a high P/E ratio and growing EPS. However, its relatively high beta of 0.985 and dependence on Windows and Office revenue make it a moderate-risk investment that can be allocated in a conservative portfolio."
