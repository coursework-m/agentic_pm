    "ticker": "AAPL",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
    "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. Despite facing increased competition in the smartphone market, Apple's strong brand and ecosystem continue to drive growth, and its services segment continues to expand. The company's fundamentals remain strong, with a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.53%. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, and Apple's revenue growth may be affected."

    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has been facing increased competition in the online advertising market, and its diversified revenue streams and strong brand continue to drive growth. However, the company's reliance on advertising revenue makes it vulnerable to economic downturns, and its recent launch of Google Stadia has been met with skepticism. The company's fundamentals remain strong, but its beta is relatively high, making it more susceptible to market fluctuations."

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has been experiencing strong growth in its cloud computing segment, driven by the increasing adoption of Azure and Office 365. The company's recent acquisition of Nuance Communications has expanded its offerings in the healthcare and AI markets. Microsoft's fundamentals remain strong, with a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.74%. However, the company's dependence on the US market and its relatively low beta make it vulnerable to economic downturns."
