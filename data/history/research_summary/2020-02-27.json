    "ticker": "GOOGL",
    "approved": false,
    "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
    "reasoning": "GOOGL has faced increased competition in the advertising market, leading to a decline in its stock price.

  {
    "ticker": "MSFT",
    "approved": true,
    "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
    "reasoning": "MSFT has shown significant growth in its cloud computing segment, driven by the increasing adoption of its Azure platform.
