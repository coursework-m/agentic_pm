    "ticker": "VXX",
    "summary": "The iPath Series B S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures ETN (VXX) has experienced a significant decline in price over the past few trading sessions, with a drop of 2.55% today. This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in interest rates, which has led to a decrease in volatility expectations and subsequently a decrease in VIX futures prices. However, the VIX index has been volatile in recent times, and its value can fluctuate rapidly. The ETN's exposure to futures contracts on the VIX index means that its price movements are closely tied to the VIX index. Despite the recent decline, the VIX index has been trending upwards in the long term, indicating a potential rebound in volatility. The ETN's price may experience a bounce back as volatility expectations increase. However, the current price is relatively low compared to its historical highs, making it a potentially attractive buy for those looking to capitalize on the potential rebound in volatility.",
