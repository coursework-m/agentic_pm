Despite a slight decline in its stock price, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward P/E ratio of 22.58 and an EPS of $9.37. The company's beta is relatively stable at 1.01, indicating a moderate level of volatility.

Given the current market conditions and the lack of fundamental data, I would recommend a HOLD stance on VXX.",
