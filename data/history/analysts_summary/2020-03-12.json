    "summary": "Apple Inc. has shown resilience in the current market downturn, with a strong brand and diverse product portfolio. The company's fundamentals, including a forward P/E ratio of 23.5 and EPS of $6.42, suggest a relatively stable financial position. However, the recent decline in iPhone sales and increasing competition in the smartphone market may impact future growth. Analysts' consensus rating of 2.09 out of 5 suggests a neutral outlook. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD position.",
