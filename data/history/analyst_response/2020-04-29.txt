After analyzing the latest market data, news, and fundamentals for each stock, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "summary": "Apple Inc. is showing strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a positive outlook. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may make it vulnerable to a correction. Overall, I recommend a BUY recommendation for AAPL.",
        "recommendation": "BUY"
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "summary": "Alphabet Inc. has a strong track record of innovation and growth, but its P/E ratio is relatively low compared to its peers. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are mixed, with some analysts expressing concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its advertising business. However, Alphabet's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet make it a HOLD recommendation.",
        "recommendation": "HOLD"
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "summary": "Microsoft Corporation has a strong track record of growth and innovation, with a high P/E ratio and a growing EPS. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are overwhelmingly positive, with many analysts expecting continued growth in its cloud computing and productivity software businesses. Overall, I recommend a BUY recommendation for MSFT.",
        "recommendation": "BUY"
    }
]
```

Rationale:

* AAPL: Apple's strong fundamentals, including a high P/E ratio and growing EPS, suggest a positive outlook for the company. However, the stock's price is relatively high, which may make it vulnerable to a correction. Nevertheless, Apple's strong brand and innovative products make it a BUY recommendation.
* GOOGL: Alphabet's strong track record of innovation and growth is evident, but its P/E ratio is relatively low compared to its peers. The company's diversified revenue streams and strong balance sheet make it a HOLD recommendation, but some analysts' concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its advertising business may limit its upside.
* MSFT: Microsoft's strong track record of growth and innovation, including a high P/E ratio and growing EPS, suggests a positive outlook for the company. Many analysts expect continued growth in its cloud computing and productivity software businesses, making it a BUY recommendation.
