  "summary": "Meta Platforms, Inc. has experienced a significant decline in its stock price over the past few days, with a -1.99% drop in price. Despite this, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward PE ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58. The beta of 1.27 indicates a relatively high volatility, but the company's dividend yield of 0.28% suggests a relatively stable income stream. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. However, the recent decline in price may be a response to the increasing competition in the social media space and the company's struggles to adapt to the changing user behavior. Overall, the company's fundamentals suggest a HOLD recommendation, but the recent price decline may indicate a potential buying opportunity.",
