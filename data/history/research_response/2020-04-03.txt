After analyzing the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The recent decline in its stock price may be due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the shift to remote work, which could lead to increased demand for its products.

    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL's recent decline in stock price may be due to the increasing competition in the advertising market, and its high P/E ratio and low dividend yield suggest that it may be overvalued."
    },
    {

        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,

    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: Despite the recent decline in its stock price, AAPL's stable fundamentals, such as its high P/E ratio and dividend yield, suggest that it may be undervalued. The company's strong brand and diverse product portfolio also make it a good candidate for a conservative portfolio.
* GOOGL: GOOGL's recent decline in stock price may be due to the increasing competition in the advertising market, and its high P/E ratio and low dividend yield suggest that it may be overvalued. Additionally, the analysis summary does not mention any positive factors that would suggest a buy recommendation.
* MSFT: MSFT's recent decline in stock price may be due to the increasing competition in the cloud computing market, and its high P/E ratio and high dividend yield suggest that it may be overvalued. The analysis summary does not mention any positive factors that would suggest a buy recommendation.

Note that these recommendations are based on the provided data and analysis summary, and may not reflect the current market situation or future performance of the companies.
