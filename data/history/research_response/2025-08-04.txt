This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in market volatility, which has led to a decrease in the demand for VIX futures contracts. However, the underlying fundamentals of the security remain relatively stable, with no changes in the price-to-earnings ratio, forward price-to-earnings ratio, or earnings per share. The dividend yield is also unchanged at 0%. The beta of the security is currently null, indicating that it is not correlated with the overall market. The sector and industry are also null, suggesting that the security is not classified under a specific sector or industry. The news section is empty, indicating no recent news or events that may impact the security's price. The analyst recommendation score is also null, indicating no current analyst recommendations.
