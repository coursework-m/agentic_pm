    }}
    ```
                                 
    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security,

This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has risen to 23.42, indicating increased market volatility. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and its market capitalization remains relatively stable. However, the lack of analyst recommendations and news coverage suggests that investors may be cautious about the security's prospects.",

Additionally, the VIX index's recent increase in value indicates increased market volatility, which may negatively impact the security's performance.
