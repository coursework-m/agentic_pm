Based on the provided data, I have analyzed each security and made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL is showing strong fundamentals, with a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.53%. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also positive, with a score of 2.08696. However, the stock's price has been volatile, with a 1.07% change in the past day. Considering these factors, I recommend a BUY."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a lower P/E ratio and a lower dividend yield compared to AAPL. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also neutral, with a score of 1.58209. Considering these factors, I recommend a HOLD."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 6.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a high P/E ratio and a high dividend yield of 0.74%. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations are also positive, with a score of 1.41667. However, the stock's price has been volatile, with a 1.11% change in the past day. Considering these factors, I recommend a BUY."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: The company's strong fundamentals, including a high P/E ratio and a dividend yield of 0.53%, make it an attractive investment opportunity. The positive recent news and analyst recommendations, with a score of 2.08696, further support this recommendation. However, the stock's price volatility, with a 1.07% change in the past day, is a concern. Therefore, I recommend a target allocation of 4.0% to AAPL.
* GOOGL: The company's lower P/E ratio and lower dividend yield compared to AAPL make it a less attractive investment opportunity. The neutral recent news and analyst recommendations, with a score of 1.58209, do not provide sufficient justification for a buy recommendation. Therefore, I recommend a target allocation of 0.0% to GOOGL.
* MSFT: The company's high P/E ratio and high dividend yield of 0.74% make it an attractive investment opportunity. The positive recent news and analyst recommendations, with a score of 1.41667, further support this recommendation. However, the stock's price volatility, with a 1.11% change in the past day, is a concern. Therefore, I recommend a target allocation of 6.0% to MSFT.
