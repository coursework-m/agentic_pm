My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: Apple Inc. has a strong brand and diverse product portfolio, which provides a stable financial position. Although the recent decline in iPhone sales and increasing competition in the smartphone market may impact its growth prospects, the company's fundamentals, including a forward P/E ratio of 23.5 and EPS of $6.42, suggest a relatively stable financial position. Therefore, I recommend a HOLD position for Apple Inc.
* GOOGL: Alphabet Inc. is under pressure due to increasing competition in the advertising market and concerns over data privacy, which may impact its growth prospects. The high valuation and declining ad revenue make it a less desirable addition to a conservative portfolio. Therefore, I recommend a SELL position for Alphabet Inc.
* MSFT: Microsoft Corporation has shown resilience in the current market downturn, with a strong track record of innovation and a diverse product portfolio. The company's strong financial position and growth prospects in cloud computing and Azure adoption make it a suitable addition to a conservative portfolio. Therefore, I recommend a BUY position for Microsoft Corporation.
