After analyzing the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 5.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL has a strong fundamental profile with a high P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. The company's recent decline in price may be a buying opportunity, and its strong brand and ecosystem make it a leader in the tech industry."

    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a solid fundamental profile, but its recent decline in price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its advertising business. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a stable investment, the current market conditions make it less attractive to me."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong fundamental profile, but its recent decline in price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its software business. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a stable investment, the current market conditions make it less attractive to me."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: I believe AAPL is a strong candidate for investment due to its high P/E ratio and high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. The company's strong brand and ecosystem make it a leader in the tech industry, and its recent decline in price may be a buying opportunity.
* GOOGL: While GOOGL has a solid fundamental profile, its recent decline in price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its advertising business. Although the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a stable investment, the current market conditions make it less attractive to me.
* MSFT: Similarly, MSFT has a strong fundamental profile, but its recent decline in price may be due to concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its software business. While the company's diversified revenue streams and strong brand make it a stable investment, the current market conditions make it less attractive to me.

Note that these recommendations are based on my analysis of the provided data and may not reflect the actual performance of these stocks in the future.
