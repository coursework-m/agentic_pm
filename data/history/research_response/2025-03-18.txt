  "summary": "Meta Platforms, Inc. has experienced a significant decline in its stock price over the past few days, with a -2.948% drop in price. Despite this, the company's fundamentals remain strong, with a forward P/E ratio of 30.41 and an EPS of $27.58. The beta of 1.27 indicates a relatively high volatility in the stock price. The company's dividend yield is 0.28%, which is relatively low compared to its peers in the Communication Services sector. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. However, the recent decline in the stock price may indicate a potential correction or a shift in investor sentiment. Considering these factors, I would recommend a HOLD position on Meta Platforms, Inc.",

The analyst's recommendation of HOLD is also aligned with a conservative portfolio strategy. However, the relatively high beta of 1.27 indicates a potential for volatility, so a cautious approach is advised. Therefore, I recommend allocating 3.5% of the portfolio to Meta Platforms, Inc."

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news.

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations

        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{

        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "... is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio..."
    }}

    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while 
    containing all required fields for the security. If you do not approve the security,
