Based on the provided data, I have analyzed each security and made the following recommendations:

    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: The company's strong track record of innovation, loyal customer base, and recent acquisition of Dark Sky demonstrate its commitment to growth. The stock has been volatile, but its recent price increase suggests a potential buy opportunity.
* GOOGL: GOOGL's high PE ratio and relatively low EPS compared to its peers make it less attractive. The company's stable performance and recent price increase may not be sustainable, and analysts have a neutral outlook.
* MSFT: MSFT is a leader in the software industry with a strong track record of innovation and a large customer base. The company's recent acquisition of Nuance Communications is a positive sign, and its expansion into the cloud computing market with Azure is a growing trend. The stock has been volatile, but its recent price increase suggests a potential buy opportunity.
