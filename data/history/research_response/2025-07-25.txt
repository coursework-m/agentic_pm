The company's high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.89 and forward P/E of 30.41 indicate that investors are optimistic about its future growth prospects. The EPS of $27.58 suggests that the company is generating significant profits. However, the beta of 1.27 indicates that its stock is more volatile than the overall market. The dividend yield of 0.28% is relatively low, which may not be attractive to income-seeking investors.
