  "target_allocation_percent": 3.5,
  "reasoning": "Amazon.com, Inc.'s strong fundamentals, including a high price-to-earnings ratio and a beta of 1.314, indicate a relatively high level of volatility. However, the recent news coverage is somewhat bullish, with mentions of its valuation and Warren Buffett's investment in AI stocks. The neutral overall market sentiment and slightly above-average analyst recommendation score suggest that the company's recent performance is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. Therefore, I recommend holding onto AMZN with a target allocation of 3.5%."

Despite this, the ETN's price remains relatively stable compared to its historical volatility, indicating a potential buying opportunity. However, the lack of fundamental data available for the security, including EPS, P/E ratio, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to make a definitive recommendation.",
