This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in interest rates, which has led to a decrease in investor sentiment and a rise in volatility. The VIX index, which VXX tracks, has also seen a significant increase in value, indicating higher investor expectations of future market volatility. Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reflected this increase in volatility, suggesting that there may be opportunities for investors to buy at a discounted price.
