Despite this, the ETN's price has not yet reached its historical lows, and its market capitalization remains relatively stable at $49.51. The lack of analyst recommendations and news articles suggests that investors are cautious about the market's direction, which may be a buying opportunity. However, the ETN's exposure to futures contracts on the VIX index means that its price can be volatile, and investors should be prepared for potential further price swings.

The lack of analyst recommendations and news articles suggests that investors are cautious about the market's direction, which may be a buying opportunity. However, the current situation does not align with a conservative portfolio allocation, and therefore, I do not recommend allocating any percentage of the portfolio to VXX."
