On the other hand, the forward P/E ratio of 22.58 suggests that investors are expecting further growth in the future. The EPS of $9.37 is relatively high compared to its industry peers, indicating strong profitability. The beta of 1.01 indicates that the stock is relatively stable and less volatile compared to the overall market. The dividend yield of 0.43% is relatively low, indicating that the company may not be paying out a significant portion of its earnings as dividends.

Despite this, the company's recent news and headlines have been mixed, with some indicating a decline in user growth and others highlighting the company's efforts to expand into new markets.

The lack of recent news and analyst recommendations makes it challenging to determine the underlying cause of the price drop. However, the VIX index, which the ETN tracks, has been increasing in recent months, indicating increased market volatility. This could be a sign of a potential rebound in the price of VXX. Considering the current market conditions and the lack of fundamental data, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX.",
