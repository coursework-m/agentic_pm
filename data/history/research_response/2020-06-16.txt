    "ticker": "MSFT",

  }
]
```

Note that I have assigned a target allocation of 0.0% to GOOGL and MSFT due to their sideways trends and lack of dividend yield, making them less suitable for a conservative portfolio. AAPL is assigned a target allocation of 4.0% due to its stable performance and attractive dividend yield.
