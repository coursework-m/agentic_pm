As a result, the VIX index has surged, and the VXX, which tracks the VIX, has also seen a substantial gain. The current price of $56.28 is above its 50-day moving average, indicating a bullish trend. However, the lack of fundamental data, including EPS and PE ratio, makes it challenging to determine the sustainability of this trend.
