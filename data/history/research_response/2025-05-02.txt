This decline is largely attributed to the recent increase in the VIX index, which has been rising due to concerns over inflation and interest rates. Despite this, the ETN's price has been volatile in the past, and its value can be affected by various market and economic factors. The lack of fundamental data available for VXX, including EPS, P/E ratio, and dividend yield, makes it challenging to make an informed decision. However, the current news and analyst recommendations are not available, which may indicate a lack of consensus among analysts. Considering these factors, I would recommend a HOLD position on VXX, as the current decline may be a correction rather than a sign of a long-term trend.
