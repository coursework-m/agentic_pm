    2. Use detailed analysis and reasoning to justify your conclusion.
    
    For the security, return:
        - "ticker"
        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:
    
    ```json
    {{
