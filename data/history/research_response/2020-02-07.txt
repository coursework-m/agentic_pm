        Here is the analysis data:

Based on the provided data, I have analyzed the three securities: AAPL, GOOGL, and MSFT. Here are my recommendations:

```json

    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL has a strong fundamental profile with a high P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a positive outlook, with a high analyst recommendation score. However, the stock's price has been volatile, and the recent decline in price may be a correction. Therefore, I recommend a BUY recommendation for Apple Inc."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": false,
        "target_allocation_percent": 0.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a strong fundamental profile with a low P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. However, the company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a neutral outlook, with a moderate analyst recommendation score. The stock's price has been stable, but the recent increase in price may be due to a short squeeze. Therefore, I do not recommend holding Alphabet Inc. at this time."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a strong fundamental profile with a high P/E ratio and a high EPS, indicating a potential for long-term growth. The company's recent news and analyst recommendations suggest a positive outlook, with a high analyst recommendation score. However, the stock's price has been volatile, and the recent increase in price may be due to a short squeeze. Therefore, I recommend a BUY recommendation for Microsoft Corporation."
    }

Note that I have assigned a target allocation of 4.0% to each of AAPL and MSFT, as they have strong fundamental profiles and positive analyst recommendations. I have not assigned any allocation to GOOGL due to its neutral outlook and moderate analyst recommendation score.
