Based on the provided securities data and analysis summary, I have analyzed each stock and made the following recommendations:

```json
[
    {
        "ticker": "AAPL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 4.0,
        "reasoning": "AAPL is stable and aligns with a conservative portfolio. The company's strong brand and diversified product portfolio make it a solid choice for long-term investors, despite some concerns about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "GOOGL",
        "approved": true,
        "target_allocation_percent": 2.0,
        "reasoning": "GOOGL has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, making it a solid choice for long-term investors. However, its PE ratio is slightly below the industry average, which may indicate some concerns about its growth prospects."
    },
    {
        "ticker": "MSFT",
        "approved": false,
        "reasoning": "MSFT has a high PE ratio, which may indicate overvaluation. Additionally, its dividend yield is relatively low, which may not be attractive to income-seeking investors. While the company has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, its high valuation may make it less appealing to conservative investors."
    }
]
```

My reasoning for the recommendations is as follows:

* AAPL: The company's strong brand and diversified product portfolio make it a solid choice for long-term investors. Its PE ratio is slightly above the industry average, but its EPS of $6.42 is impressive, and its dividend yield of 0.53% is attractive. Given its stable performance and strong fundamentals, I recommend allocating 4% of the portfolio to AAPL.
* GOOGL: GOOGL has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, making it a solid choice for long-term investors. However, its PE ratio is slightly below the industry average, which may indicate some concerns about its growth prospects. Given its stable performance and strong fundamentals, I recommend allocating 2% of the portfolio to GOOGL.
* MSFT: MSFT has a high PE ratio, which may indicate overvaluation. Additionally, its dividend yield is relatively low, which may not be attractive to income-seeking investors. While the company has a strong brand and diversified revenue streams, its high valuation may make it less appealing to conservative investors. Given its high valuation and relatively low dividend yield, I do not recommend allocating any funds to MSFT.
