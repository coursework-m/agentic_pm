  "summary": "Meta Platforms, Inc. has shown a strong upward trend in its stock price, with a 17.37% increase over the past month, driven by the company's continued growth in its Family of Apps segment. The company's fundamentals, including its forward PE ratio of 30.41 and EPS of $27.58, suggest that it has a solid financial position. However, the beta of 1.27 indicates that the stock is more volatile than the overall market. Analysts have given the company a score of 1.44 out of 5, indicating a generally positive sentiment. Despite this, the company's recent news and headlines have been mixed, with some analysts expressing concerns about the impact of increasing competition in the social media space.

You are a financial research analyst.
    Your task is to analyze the latest security's data and analysis summary then

    You will be provided with data for one security at a time.

    First, analyse the security's data and think through using fundamentals,
    market data and news.

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)
        - News and recent headlines
        - Analyst recommendations

        - "approved": true or false
        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial

    Finally, summarise your conclusions in the following JSON format:
    
    Here are my recommendations:

    Ensure your JSON is valid and is surounded by the ```json {{...}}```block shown while
