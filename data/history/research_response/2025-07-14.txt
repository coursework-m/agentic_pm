    For the security:

    1. Examine and interpret all available data, including:
        - Market Data (price, change, volume, etc.)
        - Fundamentals (P/E, EPS, beta, etc.)

        - "target_allocation_percent": `%` of total portfolio (float)
        - "reasoning": your reasoning for approval/denial
